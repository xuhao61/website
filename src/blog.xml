         <description><![CDATA[<div>After much delay, here is the 2nd preview of the work being done behind the scenes on Media Browser Theater. In this post, we'll be showing the new home screen and item detail page.<br><br><iframe id="ytplayer" class="EmbeddedVideo" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://youtube.com/embed/YW5oR6KX5LU?html5=1&amp;fs=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><strong class="bbc">Home</strong><br>The new home page now contains all home page sections on one continous smooth-scrolling page.

Like the home page, all content can be found on a single continuous page.<br><br>The new item details page is designed to surface the content and actions that you are most likely to take, and present them to you without requiring that you dive through multiple menus to get there.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/709/54235ad8bf5ad_MBTDetails.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 36px">Join the Team</span><br><br>Media Browser Theater is built with c#, WPF, and other .NET technologies.

         <title>Windows Phone App Gets Minor Update</title>

         <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 21:21:47 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>I know, I know, it's been a while since the app last got updated, I apologise for this. I also apologise that this is mostly a minor update too, but it's still quite an important one.<br><br>So what's changed? For the most part, this update is all about bringing the app up to speed with all the recent under the hood changes that have been going on with the Media Browser server, making sure it's ready for some future updates to the server itself.<br><br>That's not to say those are the only changes, there have been various bug fixes and enhancements done that will improve your browsing experience, as well as your streaming experience (no, not a change of bitrate, yet). A full list of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.WindowsPhone/issues?q=milestone%3A.62+is%3Aclosed" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">here</a>.<br><br>Now, I know this blog post is about the release just gone out, but I just wanted to take a moment to give an idea of the roadmap for the next release and what that will include. Basically: Server Playlists, Channels, ability to change the bitrate of videos, and a few other things.<br><br>In the meantime, the update (8.0.62.0) should be <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=f4971ed9-f651-4bf6-84bb-94fd98613b86" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">appearing in the store</a> shortly.<br><br><strong class="bbc">NOTE:</strong> This update will require to sign back in again, the server details you had previously will be there, you just need to authenticate with the server again.</div>]]></description>

         <title>Media Browser 3.0.5366 Released</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/media-browser-3-0-5366-released.html</link>
         <pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new server release is available which features significant improvements to our transcoder in terms of performance, reliability and features. Without much further ado, here are the highlights:<ul class="bbc"><li>Improved reliability and quality of video transcoding</li><li>A new transcoding throttling feature which can dramatically reduce cpu usage in certain situations</li><li>Improved support for Advanced SubStation Alpha and SRT subtitles</li><li>Improved DLNA reliability</li><li>Added DLNA special folders</li><li>Added resume progress bars with DLNA images</li><li>Support webp image output for faster browsing</li><li>Support for additional photo metadata</li><li>Support for album disc sub-folders</li><li>Display mirror setting now remembered</li><li>Added an option to save metadata and images as hidden files</li><li>Added an option to control when chapter images are extracted</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">New Transcoding Features</span><br><br>Our transcoding has improved significantly. Not only is it faster and more reliable than ever, but it will also throttle itself when it gets far enough ahead of the player. Let's take a look at how that works. Simply start playing something and monitor the cpu usage from ffmpeg:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540b5a5f601d1_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>As you can see it starts out pretty high, but depending on the content being played the transcoder may be able to move at a faster rate than you're actually watching. Let's monitor that from the server dashboard:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540b5ad144b56_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>As you can see the transcoder position (in red), is a few minutes ahead of your current position. Media Browser Server is able to identify this and throttle the transcoder in order to reduce cpu usage:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540b5b29c851f_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The throttling is smart and will speed up and slow down as needed in order to maintain smooth playback. Now the reduced load on your server will allow more devices to stream simultaneously without putting too much pressure on your system.<br><br>But these are not the only transcoding improvements. Our handling of SRT and Advanced SubStation Alpha subtitles has improved and is now more efficient and reliable than ever.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Improved DLNA Support</span><br><br>This release also brings a number of DLNA enhancements. For starters, device compatibility has increased significantly thanks to pull requests submitted by 7Illusions.<br><br>In addition, we now display special folders throughout your library. Click into your TV, Movie, or Music sections and you'll see some nice categories like Resume, Next Up, Latest, Favorites, etc.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540b5dbe6999c_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>In addition, you'll now see progress bars for titles that can be resumed, just like you're accustomed to with our other apps:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540b5df0dfc8d_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">WebP Image Output Support</span><br><br>This is a technology feature for the developers. WebP is an open source image format designed by Google that achieves as much as a 34% reduction in file size from JPG/PNG at the same level of quality. This is going to allow faster browsing with apps that are capable of supporting them.<br><br>Look for WebP support soon in the following apps:<ul class="bbc"><li>Web Client with Chrome and Chrome Android browsers</li><li>All Android apps</li><li>Chromecast</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">New Photo Metadata Support</span><br><br>With this release we are now capturing more robust photo metadata, with stats such as Aperture, Shutter Speed, Latitude, Longitude, and a long list of others. This is only the beginning of our photo revamp and you can expect robust filtering as well as slideshows and galleries in future updates.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Album Disc Sub-Folder Support</span><br><br>A long requested feature, we now support numbered disc sub-folders. Please see the music section of the knowledge base for details:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/674-media-files-folders-structure/?p=21480" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/674-media-files-folders-structure/?p=21480</a><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Join the Media Browser Team</span><br><br>As always, we're looking to grow the team with new developers, testers, designers, or any skill set you bring that you feel can help us. In particular we are looking for more Android and iOS developers to help bring us onto new devices and form factors that are rapidly becoming popular, such as living room set top boxes and wearables.

         <title>Introducing Media Browser Player : Win 8.1 App</title>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>I have been very impressed with the Media Browser web interface, it is simple but at the same time fully functional with all browsing and management functions at your fingertips.<br><br>I wanted to use the web interface for my daily use on my Surface RT and Windows 8.1 laptop but the web browser playback experience was very poor with limited functionality and stability. What I wanted was the web interface but with a solid streaming playback solution.<br><br>What I came up with was a new simple player that integrates with the default web interface and automatically intercepts play commands to play the result in its own player.<br><br>When started the client loads the main Media Browser web interface and auto sets the Remote to control the local instance of the applications streaming player, this mean all play commands are now sent to the local custom player.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/1880/53fd3306be4c0_RemoteIcons.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Play actions including resumes are now sent to the "Media Browser Player" which is waiting for these actions.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/1880/53fd33d947625_RemoteActions.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>When the playback starts the new player pops up.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/1880/53fd367cbc3af_MBPScreen03detailssmall.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The player interface has a lot of information, to hide the info just tap the video and it will go full screen.<br><br>I have tried to include as much of the streaming transcode information as possible, this information can help you diagnose problems, for example if you are experiencing a lot of buffering it could be due to the speed of the transcode not keeping up or it could be that your wifi is not able to keep up. Both of these can be diagnosed with this interface.<br><br>Finally I wanted as much control over the streaming setting as I could get so I added whatever I could find to the streaming settings.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/1880/53fd37f682a86_RemoteIcons.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>While this is not everything it is enough to get you started with experimenting with different streaming settings in your environment.<br><br>This app is not for everyone, it is more for the people what want a better streaming playback experiences than the default web interface can supply but still want the the flexibility and power of the default web interface.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Grab it form the app store now</strong><br><br><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/media-browser-player/53db60e4-8885-46f6-95d9-cdafb3cd9480" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/media-browser-player/53db60e4-8885-46f6-95d9-cdafb3cd9480</a><br><br>Feedback is greatly appreciated, please use the following forum thread:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9743-media-browser-player-win-81-store-app/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9743-media-browser-player-win-81-store-app/</a></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>We're please to announce revamped Chromecast support. This is currently featured in the web client and will soon be making it's way to Android, iPhone and iPad. Let's go through how it works and you'll see how easy it is.<br><br>You'll start by clicking the remote control icon you've come to know and love.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f76d65f072c_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Upon doing so, the Chromecast extension will appear and allow you to select the Chromecast receiver you'd like to cast to.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f76dbacff69_Untitled1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Once the connection is established, you'll see the player icon light up in the top right-hand corner.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f76e1c67cfc_Untitled2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>In addition, you'll see a friendly welcome screen on your TV:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f76f50810b9_Ready.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Now you can send content to Chromecast just like you would any other device. Let's go through some examples of that. Let's play a movie. First, we're going to go back and enable the optional mirror mode function, so that everyone in the room can see the the movie information before starting playback.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f7741358de5_Untitled11.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Now let's go view The Avengers in the browser. Voila, it also shows up on the TV. Wait, is this Media Browser Theater? No, it's Chromecast!<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f77010a8549_MirrorDetail.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Now click play in the browser, and you'll be treated to a wonderful interface on-screen to control the content:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f7704044613_Paused.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Music looks great too:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f770bdc2875_Song.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Subtitles (Look, no transcoding!)</span><br><br>Our subtitle text delivery system that you've seen in other clients is also featured in Chromecast. We do everything possible to avoid transcoding, and text-based delivery of subtitles via WebVTT is one of many techniques we use to make playback as efficient as possible.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53f77314c0565_Untitled9.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports Intros</span><br><br>If you use the Intros plugin, this is now supported bringing the cinema experience to Chromecast.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports Channels &amp; Live TV</span><br><br>Title says it all.

         <description><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size: 24px">Give me my playlists!</span><br><br>With this new release we've added the ability to create playlists in the web client, but it also brings some other improvements and fixes. Here's the rundown:<br><ul class="bbc"><li>Create playlists in the web client</li><li>Improved DLNA compatibility and image support</li><li>Increased server localization</li><li>Chrome will now direct stream compatible mkv's</li><li>New People metadata settings</li><li>New channel downloading settings</li><li>New folder view setting</li><li>New local password setting</li></ul>There are also some new features for developers:<ul class="bbc"><li>TTML subtitle output</li><li>VTT segmentation within m3u8 playlists</li></ul>And a few important fixes:<ul class="bbc"><li>Fixed open subtitle password issue (Windows users will need to reconfigure their passwords)</li><li>Fixed auto-organize not running on a schedule</li><li>Live TV recording paths not updating</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Playlists</span><br><br>The highlight of this release is the ability to create playlists from the web client. In the coming weeks you'll see this feature rolled out to all of our clients. How do you create a playlist? Easy!<br><br>Right click any song, album, artist, genre, movie, tv series, season or episode:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53e95e46f0491_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Mobile users can also accomplish this via the tap-hold menus. Then you'll see a nifty slideout menu:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53e95e722c44e_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Once added, you'll have a new Playlists section on your home page.

Be sure to leave feedback and be a part of the process.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">DLNA Improvements</span><br><br>Persistence pays off, and thanks to the efforts of a few community members our DLNA device support has improved significantly with this release. Even devices that were already functioning should see improved image support. Users with custom profiles will need to rebuild them using the new system profiles as a base.<br><br>DLNA also has a couple new features - Live TV support, as well as a new device profile setting to control music transcoding bitrate.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">People Metadata</span><br><br>Do your actor biographies take a long time to download? We feel your pain. Now you can limit this with new fine tuning controls.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53ecbba6725fc_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Channel Settings</span><br><br>Now you can easily control the size of your downloaded channel content.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53ecbc404ac9f_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Folder View Setting</span><br><br>Now there is an option to display a plain folder view as part of your customizable user views. If enabled this will show up in any client that supports user views, including the web client, DLNA, MBT, and soon Roku.<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53ecbd13cf46d_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Local Password Setting</span><br><br>Now you can configure easy login ability when users are inside your home network.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/53ee382aef3ea_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Join the Team</span><br><br>As always we're recruiting and looking for new developers to step up and join us.

         <title>Media Browser Server 3.0.5416 Beta Released</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/media-browser-server-3-0-5416-beta-released.html</link>
         <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2014 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size: 24px">Introducing Media Browser Connect</span><br><br>As many of you know, we have a lot of really smart people here in our community, and great things happen when we put our minds together. We've been longing for a way to make it easier to access your server when you're away from home, and we're pleased to announce our solution. It's Media Browser Connect.<br><br>Now you can use your forum username and password to sign into any Media Browser app from any location, and it will know how to locate your server in the most efficient way possible. This means you no longer have to fumble with IP addresses. Not only does this make it easier to access your server, it also makes it easier to mange multiple servers and <strong class="bbc">share with your friends</strong>.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">So how does it work?</span><br><br>It's very easy. For existing users that you've already setup, simply edit their user profile and enter their forum username or email address. The local server account will then be linked to the forum account. Once they accept the invitation email, they'll then be able to use their forum credentials to sign in to your server, without having to know the server's IP address.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452981e6e667_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>In the user list, you'll see a cloud to indicate the user has a Connect account.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452985d55657_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Invite Your Friends</span><br><br>You'll notice a new Guests section on the user management page.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529b1f8e797_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>What are guests? Guests are forum users that you've invited to use your server. Simply click the plus button next to Guests, and you'll be presented with a popup to invite a forum user. You can even choose which libraries they'll have access to.<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529b77acc8a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>By default guests have very limited permissions, and you'll have full control over what they'll have access to.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Local Accounts, Cloud Accounts - You Decide</span><br><br>While we expect this feature to be very popular, we know that many prefer local accounts and we're pleased to say they're not going anywhere. Both of the features work very well together and we expect to continue to improve on this.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">App Support</span><br><br>This has been a large team effort and you can expect to see updates for all of our apps soon. Here's a few teasers to wet your appetite.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529eba9748d_54501835aa6c0_mbconnect.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452a480e8cc2_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452a70917ba5_MBConnectFirstRun.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Try the Hosted Web Client</span><br><br>We now have a hosted version of the web client at:<br><br><a href="http://app.mediabrowser.tv" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://app.mediabrowser.tv</a><br><br>Simply use your Connect (forum) login, and then you can access any of your servers (owned or shared).<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529050a5167_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Once you sign in, you'll see the very same web client you've come to know and love. Switching servers is easy:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452906b7ead2_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>As you can see the layout is currently limited to one server at a time, but this is only the beginning. We know that many of you are clamoring for multi-server presentations, and we intend to deliver that in future releases.<br><br>The hosted web client has one unique advantage over the local version. It features <strong class="bbc">automatic network switching</strong> from LAN to WAN and vice versa, on the fly as needed. You might login initially within your home network, and then leave the house and transition to mobile. The app will handle it for you, all on the fly. The hosted web client is truly <strong class="bbc">one url, any time, any location</strong>.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Important Note</strong>: The hosted web client is served via static HTML and JavaScript. All communication occurs directly from your browser to your Media Browser Server, just like the regular web client. We do not have any external servers that send requests to your home server, and we do not collect any information about your media library.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">New Devices Section</span></span></span></span><br><br>There is a new Devices section in the server dashboard. Many of you have asked for device-specific settings and we now have a place to put those. For starters, you can configure a friendly name for each device, to override the name reported by it.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/545283933127e_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Camera Image Uploading</span></span></span></span><br><br>You'll notice the Devices section has a Camera Upload tab. Camera upload allows automatic uploading of images from your smartphones and tablets. It's easy! Just enable the devices you'd like to use it for, and voila!<br><br>Then go out and take some pictures, and when you come home the images will begin uploading. It's a fully automated feature. All of our mobile apps will be updated soon to support this.<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/545286d63f624_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>If you like, you can even specify a custom upload path for each device to keep albums separated. Here is a preview of image uploading on windows phone:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452a65d8bfe3_PhotoUpload.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">New Parental Control Features</span></span></span></span><br><br>Now you can define access schedules for users to control when they have access to your server.

The Movies section of the web client now has a Trailers tab, which will pull trailers from all available sources (channels, files, etc).<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54527cc4546f7_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>There's even a new nifty Trailer Reel button. What is the trailer reel? It's the ability to create a long running playlist of random movie trailers. This makes for great background video while you do the dishes.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54527d6b4598d_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>The best part about the trailer reel feature is that remote control is fully supported. You can send a trailer reel to any Media Browser app that accepts remote control commands.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">DLNA Improvements</span></span></span></span><br><br>You'll notice better dynamic category images that are based on the content within your library.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452f848194b9_Screenshot_20141030224446.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Movies that have trailers or extras are now displayed as folders, allowing you to play the main feature or any of the extras from within the DLNA client interface.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452f83e368b1_Screenshot_20141030224508.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Also, big thanks to <strong class="bbc">FuFa</strong> for his work in helping improve our Panasonic device profile, and Happy2Play for lending some of his expertise.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">Live TV Improvements</span></span><br><br>We've been working hard with <strong class="bbc">Krustyreturns</strong> and <strong class="bbc">SiliconDust</strong>, and ServerWMC users are in for a treat. If you have an HDHomerun that supports Dlna, we now use the SiliconDust api to stream directly from the tuner hardware, thereby bypassing Windows Media Center's wtv conversion process. You will notice faster video start times, increased reliability, decreased resource consumption, and improved video quality. Big thanks to <strong class="bbc">krustyreturns</strong> for his efforts on this!<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">New Argus Live TV Plugin</span></span><br><br>We're happy to welcome Argus to the community, giving you yet another choice of Live TV providers. Thanks to <strong class="bbc">Sven </strong>for his work on this. Check it out in the plugin catalog.<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54526e9eb40fe_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-size: 24px">Latest Item Settings</span></span><br><br>Some users have reported that they'd prefer not to have photos or music showing up in their latest items lists. This is now easily configured in your user preferences and will take effect within any Media Browser app that displays a global Latest Media section.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54526d588648f_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Web Client Photo Slideshow:</span><br><br>Click on any image within a photo album and you'll be treated to a visual slideshow. Best of all, it works great when you're mobile just by swiping your fingers left and right.<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54526e1af41ca_Untitled.png" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54526e1af41ca_Untitled.png</a><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Support for .STRM files:</span><br><br>These are a longtime favorite of Xbmc users. Now you can create stub files in your library containing a single media url, and the content will be displayed like any other video. Clients will then stream the content from the remote url.<br><br>Usage is simple. Create a normal text-file and rename the .txt extension to .strm then open it up with a text-editor (like Notepad in Microsoft Windows) and input the the direct url link of the stream.<br><br>For example:<pre class="prettyprint lang-auto linenums:0">
http://host/path/stream
</pre><span style="font-size: 24px">Other Improvements:</span><br><ul class="bbc"><li>Upgraded to fanart v3 api</li><li>Support Imdb url's within NFO's that appear after the closing xml tag</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Bugs Resolved:</span><br><ul class="bbc"><li>Music videos not showing up on artist page</li><li>Artists with &amp; in their name not displayed correctly</li><li>Upcoming TV not displaying certain content</li><li>"set" tag not getting saved in NFO's in certain situations</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Fully Open and Community Built</span><br><br>As you all know we're committed to open source. We have developer libraries for Media Browser Connect ready to go for a number of platforms. We want to make it easy as possible for new developers to integrate or interact with our API. Expect to see more information about this soon.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Join the Community</span><br><br>Help us build new channels and apps.

I thought I was about done...<br><br>And then users and other developers started to get involved.<br><br>@null_pointer came on board in January, offering *much* more programming experience. @im85288 came on shortly after, an expert in skinning. @elcabong joined, and contributed mods to his skins.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>This is a small maintenance release that adds a few new features and lays the groundwork for some bigger and better things to come.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Cinema Mode Feature</span><br><br>Many of you are familiar with Ebr's Intros plugin, which allows you to play trailers and custom intros before movies. This is a great plugin but we've decided to implement a small subset of the features as a core server feature.<br><br>With cinema mode you can choose to play trailers before movies or episodes, as well as your own custom intro video files. It's very simple and easy to configure.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca8e475e60_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Note that playback of trailers within cinema mode requires installation of the Trailer channel plugin.<br><br>The following apps support cinema mode:<ul class="bbc"><li>Media Browser Classic</li><li>Media Browser Theater</li><li>Roku</li><li>XBMB3C</li><li>Web Client (Desktop only)</li><li>Windows 8.1</li><li>Others soon to follow</li></ul>After setting it up, it will be enabled for all users by default. But we realize not all of your users are going to want cinema mode. Users can disable it on an individual basis within their own user preferences:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca931c9a0a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 18px">Note for Intro Users:</span><br><br>The intro plugin will completely replace the server's cinema mode feature, as it has the same feature set along with some additional advanced options.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Trailers within recommendations</span><br><br>Now you'll see trailers blended into your movie recommendation lists. It's a great way to open yourself up to new content you may not normally be exposed to.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542cb0043942d_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>But we realize some users may not want this, so it is easily disabled in user preferences.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542cb0382935c_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Support for reading watched states from Nfo's</span><br><br>We now support reading your watched state from Nfo's. This makes Nfo metadata a great way to backup play state for a single user. You'll need to make sure to select which user to apply this to:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca1a5593b0_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Support VLC as an external player in the web client</span><br><br>This is available if you're running the web client on iOS or Android. It's very easy. Simpy enable it in your web client preferences.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca0ac7df46_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Then when you play, you'll see an option to play with an external player:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca0fa5da76_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Then select the external player you want:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca1315a00a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Then launch the player with VLC. Please note this will come with some limitations, such as not being able to report progress to the server. But fear not, you can still keep track of your progress by manually indicating where you've stopped:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/542ca393c40d9_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Linux Server </span><span style="font-size: 24px">downloads</span><span style="font-size: 24px"> now on the website</span><br><br>The website now has instructions for Linux:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/download" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/download</a><br><br>The instructions come in two flavors - manual install and Docker install. An Ubuntu package is a third option that is coming soon. Check back for that later this week.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">OSX Server downloads now on the website</span><br><br>The website now has instructions for installing the server on OSX:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/download" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/download</a><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Join the Media Browser Developer Team</span><br><br>As you know we have a lot of exciting things going on here and we're looking for new developers who would like to be a part of it. We've got all sorts of secret projects being worked on and new ones in the pipeline. Whatever your skill set is, we can find a place for you. If you're experienced with Html5, JavaScript, C#, iOS, or Android, we really want you.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Looking for other contributors - User Experience and Tech Writers</span><br><br>Continuing with the above, we are looking for professional tech writers or user experience designers who might be willing to donate some occasional free time to the project.

No matter your skill set, whether it's Java, C# or even Pascal, we can find a place for you. Here are some areas we're currently looking for help with, but if you have your own ideas we'd like to hear them.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Available Projects</span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Trakt</strong><br>We are looking for a contributor to help bring new features to our Trakt plugin. Trakt has added new data to their api such as media info and more social data, and we'd like to incorporate this.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Smart TV apps</strong><br>If you're skilled with html and javascript, why not help out with our Samsung app development? It is a great app already and another contributor or two can help bring it to new levels.<br><br><strong class="bbc">ImageMagick integration</strong><br>We are moving server image processing away from GDI+ and towards ImageMagick, to help make installation easier on NAS devices such as Synology. If you're familiar with ImageMagick, an extra set of hands can help get this done sooner, and then everyone will see a wave of announcements of server availability on new devices.<br><br><strong class="bbc">New internet channels</strong><br>This one should go without saying. Channels are always in high demand.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Server analytics and reporting</strong><br>2015 will be the year of <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/30/5-trends-to-watch-for-in-big-data-in-2015/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Big Data</a>.

         <title>Windows Phone App Updated to 8.0.63.0</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/windows-phone-app-updated-to-8-0-63-0.html</link>
         <pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 12:47:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>Today I'm pleased to announce quite a hefty update to the Windows Phone app. This release brings the app up to speed with a lot of the recent features introduced to the server.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Media Browser Connect</strong><br><br>We announced recently <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-130-media-browser-server-305416-beta-released/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Media Browser Connect</a>, a way of accessing your server more conveniently by just signing in with an account, rather than trying to mess around with connection details. It's something that has been added to the <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-134-try-the-media-browser-for-roku-beta-channel/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Roku</a>, <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-132-media-browser-win81-app-v30-released/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Windows 8.1</a> apps, and <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-143-media-browser-theater-updated-with-connect/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Media Browser Theatre</a> and I'm pleased to say that it's now in the Windows Phone app.<br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/4/5471af03e1f8c_MBConnectWithLogo.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br>So now you don't need to mess around with connection settings in this app, just sign in with your Connect account, choose your server (if you have more than one), and just start using the app.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Automatic Photo Upload</strong><br><br>Now you can back your photos up to Media Browser straight from your phone. Once you have turned the feature on in the server's dashboard, go to the settings in the phone app and turn it on in there.<br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/4/5471afbdcf750_PhotoUpload.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br>Now, I have to make a few things really clear about this feature. There are a number of restrictions placed upon the app by Windows Phone itself as to when this feature can actually happen. These include:<ul class="bbc"><li>Phone must be on charge</li><li>Phone must have at least 90% battery remaining</li><li>Phone must be on a wifi connection</li><li>Phone must not be on a call</li><li>Phone must be locked</li></ul>These are constraints made by Windows Phone itself, and nothing we can do about them.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Channels</strong><br><br>A while back (sorry it's taken so long), we introduced <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-68-media-browser-server-305271-released/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">internet channels to the server</a>, well, support for those channels is now available in the Windows Phone app.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Playlists</strong><br><br>Similarly, <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-94-media-browser-server-305340-released/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">playlists</a> are now also supported.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Cinema Mode</strong><br><br>This was a more <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-117-media-browser-server-beta-305387-released/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">recent thing for the server</a>, it allows you to configure the server to give you a couple of trailers to play before you start watching a movie/tv episode. This feature does, however, require you to have the Trailers plugin installed on the server, and it's also a feature that is configured at the server level, not the app level.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Instant Mix</strong><br><br>Instant Mix is a great feature where you can choose an artist/album/track/genre, give it to the server, and it will return a playlist of similar music for you to listen to. Again, support has now been added to the Windows Phone app for this feature.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Streaming Settings</strong><br><br>You guys sure have been vocal on this feature, and I'm pleased to say that it's now there. You can now configure the app to have to have higher or lower streaming bitrates. Not only that, but you now have the option to have configurable bitrates for when you're on a Wifi connection and when you're on a mobile data connection.<br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/4/5471b2beb5048_Streamingoptions.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">UI Changes</strong><br><br>You may have already noticed from the screenshots that the UI has subtly changed. There are a few ways in which we've changed it to hopefully make it easier, and more pleasing to the eye.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Additional Languages</strong><br><br>For this release, we have also been fortunate to be able to add two new additional languages that we support: Kazakh and Norwegian. This brings our total languages to 11 now. If you'd like to see the app translated into your own native language, and would like to help us achieve that, please get in touch with us.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Sale</strong><br><br><del class="bbc">As a treat to coincide with this release, the app is also 50% off for the next 24 hours, available for &pound;1.49 ($1.99).</del><br><br><strong class="bbc">Rate and Review</strong><br><br>If you like the changes to the app, please, please, please, go to the store and leave a rating/review. The more ratings we get, the more we move up store rankings, the more we can then use that for other things.<br><br>Download the app now from the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=f4971ed9-f651-4bf6-84bb-94fd98613b86" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Windows Phone Store</a>.</div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Today we pushed a release for our Windows Phone app (8.0.66.0) which sees a massive improvement in streaming and what the app is requiring the server to transcode.<br><br>So what does this mean? Basically, if you have a video in your collection that your Windows Phone device would be able to play natively (as if you dragged the video onto your phone from your PC), then the server will know that it doesn't need to transcode the video, it can do a direct stream to your phone. This decreases the load placed upon your server machine and also increases your experience whilst watching the video.<br><br>This release also contains some smaller bug fixes around audio playback, if you were trying to stream just one track, this would fail to play, we have corrected that. A full list of bug fixes can be found on <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.WindowsPhone/issues?q=milestone%3A.66+is%3Aclosed" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Github</a>.<br><br>Now, I know what you're thinking, that's two releases for this app in a row that have mainly been bug fixes. Fear not! I promise you, the next release will be big! Offline big! And to address your other thought: yes, this will be the last major release of this app to appear under the Media Browser monika. The next release will not only have Offline support, but will be sporting our new name, Emby.<br><br>You can download the update from <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=f4971ed9-f651-4bf6-84bb-94fd98613b86" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=f4971ed9-f651-4bf6-84bb-94fd98613b86</a><br><br>As always, if you download the app (or even if you already have the app installed), do please remember to rate/review the app, we really do appreciate those.</div>]]></description>

         <title>Emby Server Beta 3.0.5557 Released</title>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new beta of Emby Server has been released with some exciting new additions. Before we go over them, if you missed our recent Emby announcement you can read all about that here:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-179-introducing-emby/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-179-introducing-emby/</a><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Introducing Cloud Sync &amp; Folder Sync</span><br><br>We worked really hard on sync during this release cycle to bring you new features that you'll find useful. Cloud &amp; Folder Sync allow you to sync media to external locations, whether it be for backup purposes or to archive content in multiple resolutions. Apps can then stream the content from the cloud instead of your server, thereby sparing your upload bandwidth.<br><br>Let's say for example you have an original copy of a movie at 40Mbps. It looks fantastic but will require transcoding anytime you'd like to stream to Roku. Now you can sync that movie to the cloud and choose a profile that will allow Roku to direct stream:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bcf378aa2_Untitled776.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>When your users stream the content, they'll direct stream from google drive rather than rely on your server for transcoding.<br><br>To setup Cloud Sync or Folder Sync, see the Services tab of the Sync control panel. Look for separate blog posts on these soon with detailed walk-throughs.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/550b00818ca6a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Cloud &amp; Folder Sync are your General Purpose Conversion Tools</span><br><br>As you sync content you're free to choose the conversion profile that will determine the output format. In future releases we intend to allow you to modify these profiles directly and even create your own.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bd0ac7bd2_Untitled778.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Goodbye GDI, Hello ImageMagick</span><br>We've migrated all of our image processing functions from GDI to ImageMagick, thus clearing the way for the server to run smoothly on NAS devices such as Synology. Look for a Synology package soon. While we were at it, we learned a few new tricks, and in the future you may see the server create more beautiful, automatic images such as<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505dc911b0ff_Untitled11.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>A big thanks to t.andre for his efforts on this!<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Emby Server Debian package now available</span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">See <a href="https://emby.media/download/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://emby.media/download/</a><br><br>Big thanks to @<a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/user/4342-hurricanehernandez/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">hurricanehernandez</a></span></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Enhanced Live TV Metadata</span><br>Live TV will now be enhanced with internet metadata for movies, and the suggestions page in the web interface now has an Upcoming Movies section.

This hasn't made it to auto-organize yet, but it's planned for the future.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">DLNA Cast &amp; Crew Setting</span><br><br>We like rich metadata, but we understand many people just want the quickest path from point A to point B. The server dashboard now has a setting to turn off the Cast &amp; Crew feature.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Fanart.TV Images</span><br><br>Support has been added for the following images:<ul class="bbc"><li>Season posters</li><li>Season banners</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Other Fixes</span><ul class="bbc"><li>Detect incomplete nfo's and supplement with internet metadata</li><li>Fixed playlist content being playable when it shouldn't be</li><li>Resolved browser-based live tv playback issues</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Join the Community</span><br><br>If you like the direction we're headed in, join us! We can find a place for anyone who would like to help, whether it be software developers, designers, testers, translators, etc. Please drop in and say hello.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Use our API Libraries</span><br><br>As many of you know, we have a public api, and nothing pleases us more when new people step up and find ways to use it. We have complete API wrappers available for:<br><ul class="bbc"><li>JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Javascript" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Javascript</a></li><li>Java/Android <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Java" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient.Java</a></li><li>C# <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient</a></li></ul></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size: 18px">We have some exciting news. Over the next couple of months, Media Browser will become <span style="color: #008000"><strong class="bbc">Emby</strong></span>.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 14px">Our new home will be <a href="https://emby.media" class="bbc_url" title="">https://emby.media</a></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 14px"><strong class="bbc">Why are we changing the name?</strong></span><br><br>Media Browser has been a great name over the past several years but we feel we have outgrown it. It is no longer descriptive of what we really are and carries with it some preconceptions in the minds of both people who may have heard about or used us in the past and new people who have never heard of us. We want to change that.<br><br><span style="font-size: 14px">So, introducing our new, short, catchy name that still pays homage to our origins (it sounds like "MB" when you say it) but lets us break free and continue to grow into the entire ecosystem that we are becoming. G<span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">iven our broad presence in all the app stores, and future potential, we wanted to come up with a short and fun name that everybody's wives, kids and grandmothers will be able to remember. We were not looking for a name that describes the project, because that's very difficult to do and, undoubtedly, will end up meaning different things to different people. Short, catchy and unique were really the top requirements.</span></span></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Why something so odd?</strong><br><br>Think "Google" or "Skype" before you knew what they were. That's what we're going for. We don't want someone to hear the name and think they know what it is based on a connotation of that particular word. We want them to hear the name and say "What's that...?". Then, as time goes on, we become the name and the name becomes a synonym for "Awesome Media Server Ecosystem".<br><br>Please know that this change has not happened overnight. The process of finding a new name has been going on for months and has been very, very difficult but, we are happy with where we have finally landed and believe it will accomplish the goals we set out when we started thinking about a new name for the project.<br><br><strong class="bbc">What about the website?</strong><br><br>The new website address will be <a href="https://emby.media" class="bbc_url" title="">emby.media</a>. Securing a domain name was one of the largest constraints in this whole process but we feel <a href="https://emby.media" class="bbc_url" title="">emby.media</a> describes what we are and will be a fine home for us going forward. We hope maybe to also get emby.tv but that is currently in use. We are working on it though. In the end, the actual domain name isn't as important as the other goals because people will find us via search engines, not by typing in a web address.<br><br><strong class="bbc">What about the logo?</strong><br><br>This is where we are going to want to enlist your help. Watch the forums for a call for submissions on ideas for a new logo to fit with our new name. We will open it up to everyone and consider all ideas. I know you guys can help us come up with a great new look for our new name.<br><br><strong class="bbc">When is all of this going to happen?</strong><br><br>The whole process will take some time as a lot of things will need to change. It won't be a single, coordinated date where you see everything change. It will trickle out over all of the different components over a period of weeks and maybe even a few months. We'll take our time and allow developers adequate time to make all of the branding changes necessary.<br><br>So, that's it. We on the dev team are very excited about this new direction and the possibilities it opens up for us for the future. Nothing is changing but the branding. The product is still going to be the best darned media solution out there. Welcome to the new ride.</div>]]></description>

         <title>The New Android TV App - Coming Soon</title>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Google announced Android TV at their annual Google I/O conference last year and we immediately saw it as a huge opportunity not only for Media Browser but also for the industry as a whole.<br><br>The smart TV market is thriving but the use of the actual smart features are greatly limited because each manufacturer, for the most part, chose to implement their own environment which makes it very difficult for app developers to support them all. This, in turn, makes it hard for users to find the apps they want.<br><br>We saw Google's new platform as a potential common platform for not only stand alone devices, but also smart TVs and, it appears, we were right.<br><br>At CES a couple of weeks ago Sony, Sharp and Philips all announced that their 2015 models would be using Google's Android TV as their smart platform.<blockquote class="ipsBlockquote"><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue"><span style="font-size: 12px">Despite a noticeable improvement in Smart TV interfaces last year, 2015 marks a turning point, with many brands abandoning their own interfaces in favour of more-widely compatible ones.</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue"><span style="font-size: 12px">The biggest winner of this move is, of course, Android TV, now used by Sony, Sharp and Philips. The system offers plenty of friendly apps and a responsive and well-designed interface. It'll be very familiar to you if you're used to Android phones. It also includes all of Google's connected services, as well as Google Cast compatibility, which allows you to share the screen of another device (e.g. smartphone) with the television via Wi-Fi.</span></span></span></p></blockquote><br>Of course, the Nexus Player is available now as a set top box solution and there will undoubtedly also be other new boxes sporting Android TV, but the TVs themselves will really make this platform a winner.<br><br>And we will be ready for them. Here is a sneak peek at our upcoming Android TV App:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7f718b477_home1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7f9944ef1_movies1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7fa681e81_views1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7fb6a681d_genres1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7fce17f52_moviedetails1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7fdc86967_moviedetails2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd7ff1df10a_tv1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd8001e33be_series1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd8013d606f_series2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd802c760ef_person1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54bd82fdc1b31_playback1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>How do you use the web client? If the answer is only on the desktop, you're missing out on the fun. Today I'm here to show you one of the areas where it truly shines the most, and that is on your smart phone and your tablet. Whether you're on Android, iOS, or Windows Phone you get a beautiful display to navigate through your media collection. It's fast, it's pretty, and it can't possibly be beat!<br><br>So the next time you want to watch a movie, try it with the web client on one of your portable devices. We think you'll be surprised with the experience you have.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd5e15872_Screenshot_20140909235226.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>But what else can you do with it? How about keep track of your latest and upcoming episodes.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd658dc24_Screenshot_20140909235321.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Or why not qeuue up a playlist for some music listening?<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd6c68d8a_Screenshot_20140909235443.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>And for what is always a crowd favorite, remote control of other Emby apps:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcfa516ea1_Screenshot_20140910000920.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">A Beautiful Live TV Guide</span><br><br>Even on a small screen, Emby's Live TV features are easy and fun.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c990f57c5c_s1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>How often have you sat down on the couch to watch a movie, and realized something needed to be done with your media, and so you got up and ran to your server room to correct the problem? This is a situation we can all relate to. Stop doing that! With the web client you have full control of the server in the palm of your hand. So the next time you want to install a new channel, don't get up, do it from the sofa!<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd7e7ab27_Screenshot_20140909235546.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>The mobile and tablet layouts support every single feature you're accustomed to from the full desktop version. Nothing is left behind on the small screen. So enjoy these last few screens and remember, you can manage Emby from anywhere that you can access the internet.<br><br>Tell us how you use it. We'd like to hear about it.<br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd86d7ca1_Screenshot_20140909235554.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd8cb8839_Screenshot_20140909235622.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd940163b_Screenshot_20140909235742.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Roboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Try the Hosted Web Client</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Roboto">We now have a hosted version of the web client at:</span></span><br><br><a href="http://app.mediabrowser.tv/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://app.emby.media/</a><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Roboto">Simply use your Connect (forum) login, and then you can access any of your servers (owned or shared).</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Roboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529050a5167_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Roboto">Once you sign in, you'll see the very same web client you've come to know and love.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Whilst this new release doesn't have a list as long as your arm with changes, the major change it does have should impact anyone who streams videos using the app. This release has moved to a better streaming method with the server app, which means the stream is better, and the server is more performant.<br><br>Also included in this release is the ability to remove old local servers from the list of servers (if you've rebuilt your machine for example).<br><br>Finally, the app is now enabled for Portuguese users.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>This is predominantly a maintenance release but there are some new goodies to enjoy. Without further ado, here are the highlights.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Control Your Cloud Sync Upload Speed</span><br><br>You can now configure this in the sync settings area.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c90cd655e6_s1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>To learn more about Cloud Sync, check out the release notes from the previous release:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-188-emby-server-305572-released/" class="bbc_url" title="">https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-188-emby-server-305572-released/</a><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Manage Your Sync Conversion Speed</span><br><br>Now you can control both the speed and the number of CPU cores that are utilized by sync conversion tasks.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c90feceef3_s2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Sync Management Settings</span><br><br>Suppose you'd like to give your users access to Sync, but you don't want them hammering your CPU. Now you can limit their access to sync transcoding so that they're only able to sync original files.<br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c93ad81216_s2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New User Management Settings</span><br><br>You now have the ability to limit a user's access to transcoding, another tool at your disposal to conserve your CPU.<br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c9400c8a4c_s1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Keep in mind that taking away transcoding could make it impossible to play some content on certain devices. When this happens, your users will receive a friendly error message:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c94781c758_s1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>We're working hard to get these graceful error messages into every Emby app. Please be patient while we do this.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Streaming Management Settings</span><br>Suppose you have limited upload speed and want to enforce a cap for all remote clients.

But as with everything else, it's all your choice.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Emby Chooses the Right One</span><br><br>You might have multiple copies of media available thanks to features like Cloud Sync, Folder Sync, and the ability to store multiple copies of a video in a single folder. Emby will choose the most efficient one for every device, and this now incorporates the above management settings. Whether it be limiting access to transcoding, or setting a bitrate limit, all of these options are taken into consideration when choosing the most efficient media source.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">An All-New Live TV Guide</span><br><br>The guide now fills the screen and is a joy to scroll or flick through. It's fast, it's pretty and it's now free of the double scrollbars it had before.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/698/552d6b6c6c1a1_Untitled1.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>And when you're mobile, it's a whole new experience that's easier and friendlier than ever.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c990f57c5c_s1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Channels are also now sorted by your favorites and likes, which will make it easier for users with hundreds of channels.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Sync Your Live TV Recordings</span><br><br>Supported by Cloud Sync, Mobile Sync and Folder Sync!<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/552c92e8b109c_s5.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Direct Play Live TV from Supported Clients</span><br><br>If you you're on the Emby Theater beta channel, you'll now enjoy Live TV without any transcoding, subject to support from your installed Live TV provider.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Have you tried CoverArt? It is just one of the additional features you get when you become an <a href="https://emby.media/donate/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Emby Supporter</a>.<br><br><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong class="bbc">Cover Art is available in the Server Plug-in Catalog</strong></span><br><br>Cover Art is an "Image Processor" for Emby Server. It does not download any artwork. What it does is take the artwork you have (either downloaded with the normal MB providers or supplied by you) and apply different specialized treatments to those images. So, it can take a plain movie poster and make it look like a Blu-Ray case, or a beveled glass case - or take your episode images and put TV frames around them so that they look obviously like TV episodes.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/525404df6db2b_3bae52c8c9e53743c0f86a71ae6347d8.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/5254086d022fd_4502874c27ec2d448e6045cc23243a49.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/5461103d18f12_caepisode.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>It can also do some very interesting things with Collections (box sets) or other folder types by creating images that represent the actual content that is within them.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/546110d6ade15_cafan.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/5461146fbc4fc_caccdiscs.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/546114d404986_camccds.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Cover Art does not modify any of your original artwork. It does its magic on the server before the images are delivered to the clients so you can easily switch between different styles and rest assured your original posters will remain intact.<br><br>You can select different treatments for different types of media. For example, movies can have a case style treatment while TV Series, Seasons and Episodes all have different styles. Additionally, these selections can be grouped into different <strong class="bbc">Profiles</strong> which allow you to define different sets of options for different physical locations within your library.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54627e78595ee_carotation1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Cover Art can also make it easy to tell more about your media with just a glance at the cover. It has the ability to put indicator icons on the covers to show the audio or video format as well as subtitle language and if the item is 3D or not.<br><br>All of this together makes Cover Art an extremely powerful and flexible way to customize your media artwork into something much more exciting than just movie posters.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/54627daf68a03_caselecttreatment3.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Install Cover Art now from the server plug-in catalog and add some polish to your MB apps. You can trial it for 14 days from the time of first install. For complete information on what CoverArt can do, see <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/800-coverart-40/?p=147176" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">here</a>.</div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Team,<br><br>Today, we're going to show you how you can be the master of your domain with Emby Users. Why create separate user accounts for each member of your household? Because users can have their own personalized media libraries, user data, recommendations, parental controls, security settings, and more. <strong class="bbc"> </strong>Users are managed by opening the server dashboard and navigating to <strong class="bbc">Users</strong>.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Users</span><br><br>Users are generally intended to be people who don't already have an online Emby Connect account. This is where most people will add the members of their household:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/MediaBrowser/Wiki/images/server/users1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>A user will be displayed with a cloud if they're linked to <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Media%20Browser%20Connect" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Emby Connect</a>. Why link to Emby Connect? Connect allows easy sign in away from home, where nothing more is needed than a username and password.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/MediaBrowser/Wiki/images/server/users6.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Guests</span><br><br>Guests are fundamentally the same as Users, but they provide an easy way to invite someone who already has an <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Media%20Browser%20Connect" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Emby Connect</a> account. This will easily import their display name and image into your server.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Feature Access</span><br><br>To manage user feature access, start by visiting the Users page and clicking on a user account. Features can easily be granted or denied, such as the ability to sync media, view live tv, manage live tv, etc. The "Allow media playback" option determines if the user is able to play media or not. This option is handy if you'd like to setup a guest user who can browse the library but not play anything.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users21.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Content Access</span><br><br>Content access allows you to configure the libraries a user is allowed to access.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users23.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Channel access also provides the same ability to control what your users can view and what they can't:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users24.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Device Access</span><br><br>Device access allows you to configure the devices a user is allowed to sign in from. By default, users can use any device.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users17.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Parental Controls by Rating</span><br><br>Easily block content from users based on their official rating:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users13.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>But sometimes it's also handy to control blocking of unrated content:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users14.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Parental Controls by Tags</span><br><br>Content can also be restricted based on the presence of tags:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users15.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Tags are treated recursively, meaning you can easily block an entire TV series just adding a tag at the series level.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Parental Controls by Access Scheduling</span><br><br>Easily block access during certain hours by creating access schedules. Now you'll never have to worry about your kids streaming videos during their biology lectures.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users16.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Advanced Controls</span><br><br>Need to quickly disable user accounts? Would you like to hide certain accounts from app login screens? Easily do that with advanced controls.<br><br>You can even take away a user's ability to edit their own profile settings. Maybe you don't want your kids accidentally changing their preferred subtitle language. Or maybe you have all your kids on one shared kids account and you'd like to manage the profile preferences yourself.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/images/server/users20.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Passwords</span><br><br>Easily create passwords to keep your accounts secure and safe.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54f9fc46f186e_pw1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>But we all know that passwords can be cumbersome in the living room, so that's why we offer an Easy Pin Code feature for in-home use:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54f9fca783406_pw2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Activity Log</span><br><br>Follow what your users are doing. Just about everything appears in the activity log, from signing in to signing out, playing or pausing content, changing passwords, settings, and more.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54f9ff453e03c_rm3.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">See What They're Watching, in Real-time</span><br><br>The server dashboard also gives you real-time access to monitor what your users are currently watching.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54f9ffb238504_rm1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Easy Remote Control</span><br><br>Need to quickly remote control a user's app? This is easily done with the remote control functions built into the web interface. Stop, pause, rewind, change audio, subtitles, and more with the tap of a finger.<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54fa0005935f3_rm2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The over-sized buttons make them very easy to tap on a smartphone or tablet, which makes it quite fun to flick through the scene selection menu:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54fa037039211_rm5.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>You can even send directional input just like a real remote:<br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54fa007ce1d12_rm4.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>We hope this gives you a little more information on what Emby Users can do. If you still have your whole family on one shared account, try creating user profiles. We think you'll enjoy them <img src="https://emby.media/community/public/style_emoticons/default/smile.png" class="bbc_emoticon" alt=":)"></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">The stable channel has been updated with a small revision over the previous release.

Before we go over them, if you missed our recent Emby announcement you can read all about that here:</span></span></span><br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-179-introducing-emby/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://mediabrowser....troducing-emby/</a><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Introducing Cloud Sync &amp; Folder Sync</span></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">We worked really hard on sync during this release cycle to bring you new features that you'll find useful. Cloud &amp; Folder Sync allow you to sync media to external locations, whether it be for backup purposes or to archive content in multiple resolutions. Apps can then stream the content from the cloud instead of your server, thereby sparing your upload bandwidth.</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Let's say for example you have an original copy of a movie at 40Mbps. It looks fantastic but will require transcoding anytime you'd like to stream to Roku. Now you can sync that movie to the cloud and choose a profile that will allow Roku to direct stream:</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bcf378aa2_Untitled776.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">When your users stream the content, they'll direct stream from google drive rather than rely on your server for transcoding.</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">To setup Cloud Sync or Folder Sync, see the Services tab of the Sync control panel. Look for separate blog posts on these soon with detailed walk-throughs.</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/550b00818ca6a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Cloud &amp; Folder Sync are your General Purpose Conversion Tools</span></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">As you sync content you're free to choose the conversion profile that will determine the output format.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Please update your bookmarks to:<br><br><a href="http://app.emby.media/" class="bbc_url" title="">http://app.emby.media/</a><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">About the Online Web Client</span></span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Simply use your Emby Connect (forum) login, and then you can access any of your servers (owned or shared).</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/54529050a5167_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Once you sign in, you'll see the very same web client you've come to know and love. Switching servers is easy:</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5452906b7ead2_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">As you can see the layout is currently limited to one server at a time, but this is only the beginning. We know that many of you are clamoring for multi-server presentations, and we intend to deliver that in future releases.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">The hosted web client has one unique advantage over the local version. It features </span></span><strong class="bbc">automatic network switching</strong><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"> from LAN to WAN and vice versa, on the fly as needed. You might login initially within your home network, and then leave the house and transition to mobile. The app will handle it for you, all on the fly. The hosted web client is truly </span></span><strong class="bbc">one url, any time, any location</strong><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">.</span></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Important Note</strong><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">: The hosted web client is served via static HTML and JavaScript. All communication occurs directly from your browser to your Emby Server, just like the regular web client. We do not have any external servers that send requests to your home server, and we do not collect any information about your media library.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">The Web Client - Your Portable Media Manager</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">How do you use the web client? If the answer is only on the desktop, you're missing out on the fun. Today I'm here to show you one of the areas where it truly shines the most, and that is on your smart phone and your tablet. Whether you're on Android, iOS, or Windows Phone you get a beautiful display to navigate through your media collection. It's fast, it's pretty, and it can't possibly be beat!</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">So the next time you want to watch a movie, try it with the web client on one of your portable devices. We think you'll be surprised with the experience you have.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd5e15872_Screenshot_20140909235226.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">But what else can you do with it? How about keep track of your latest and upcoming episodes.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd658dc24_Screenshot_20140909235321.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Or why not qeuue up a playlist for some music listening?</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd6c68d8a_Screenshot_20140909235443.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">And for what is always a crowd favorite, remote control of other Emby apps:</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcfa516ea1_Screenshot_20140910000920.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">How often have you sat down on the couch to watch a movie, and realized something needed to be done with your media, and so you got up and ran to your server room to correct the problem? This is a situation we can all relate to. Stop doing that! With the web client you have full control of the server in the palm of your hand. So the next time you want to install a new channel, don't get up, do it from the sofa!</span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd7e7ab27_Screenshot_20140909235546.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">The mobile and tablet layouts support every single feature you're accustomed to from the full desktop version. Nothing is left behind on the small screen. So enjoy these last few screens and remember, you can manage Emby from anywhere that you can access the internet.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Tell us how you use it. We'd like to hear about it.</span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd86d7ca1_Screenshot_20140909235554.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd8cb8839_Screenshot_20140909235622.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/540fcd940163b_Screenshot_20140909235742.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></div>]]></description>

Our cloud features are just beginning, so stay tuned for more!<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Recap</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">A new version of Emby Server has been released with some exciting new additions. Before we go over them, if you missed our recent Emby announcement you can read all about that here:</span></span><br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-179-introducing-emby/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://mediabrowser....troducing-emby/</a><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Introducing Cloud Sync &amp; Folder Sync</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">We worked really hard on sync during this release cycle to bring you new features that you'll find useful. Cloud &amp; Folder Sync allow you to sync media to external locations, whether it be for backup purposes or to archive content in multiple resolutions. Apps can then stream the content from the cloud instead of your server, thereby sparing your upload bandwidth.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Let's say for example you have an original copy of a movie at 40Mbps. It looks fantastic but will require transcoding anytime you'd like to stream to Roku. Now you can sync that movie to the cloud and choose a profile that will allow Roku to direct stream:</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bcf378aa2_Untitled776.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">When your users stream the content, they'll direct stream from google drive rather than rely on your server for transcoding.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">To setup Cloud Sync or Folder Sync, see the Services tab of the Sync control panel. Look for separate blog posts on these soon with detailed walk-throughs.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/550b00818ca6a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Cloud &amp; Folder Sync are your General Purpose Conversion Tools</span></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">As you sync content you're free to choose the conversion profile that will determine the output format.

         <title>Introducing Emby for Kodi (Open Beta)</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/introducing-emby-for-kodi-open-beta.html</link>
         <pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2015 20:25:35 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Hello All,</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">I am pleased to announce that we are now ready for beta testers on our second generation Kodi addon - Emby for Kodi! A whole new way to manage and view your media library!</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">For a long time we have been battling with the slowness of Python for parsing data from the server - it has been suggested many times to try to sync to the Kodi library - but this was a big project with a lot of technical hurtles.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">@<a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/user/1228-marcelveldt/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">marcelveldt</a> took on the challenge and developed a proof of concept. The rest of the Kodi/Emby team quickly agreed this was the way forward and has spent the last few weeks moving over code where it made sense, and proving out this new solution. Marcel in particular has put MANY hours into this, so please show him your appreciation!</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">We think you will find the new addon provides a much cleaner experience.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><strong class="bbc">Advantages of new AddOn:</strong></span></span><br>- <span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Work well with low-end devices such as Raspberry Pi and FireTV</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">- Works with native skins</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">- Much faster library browsing</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">- Native sorting/deleting/resume</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">- Native view setting support</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><strong class="bbc">Disadvantages:</strong></span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">- Initial setup takes a while 20 minutes on a fast machine to 2 hours on a Pi</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">The Emby addon for Kodi combines the best of Kodi - ultra smooth navigation, beautiful UIs and playback of any file under the sun, and Emby - the most powerful fully open source multi-client media metadata indexer and server.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><strong class="bbc">What is currently supported ?</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">We're still in beta stage of development. Currently these features are working:</span></span><br><ul class="bbc"><li>Movies</li><li>Sets</li><li>TV Shows</li><li>MusicVideos</li><li>Deletions are supported - enable in Kodi for Kodi side delete</li><li>Watched state/resume status sync: This is a 2-way synchronisation. Any watched state or resume status will be instantly (within seconds) reflected to or from Kodi and the server.</li></ul><strong class="bbc"><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">To get started with the Emby addon for Kodi, first follow these guides to set up Emby and Kodi:</span></span></strong><br><ul class="bbc"><li>To prevent any conflicts, remove the "old" MediaBrowser addon from your Kodi setup.</li><li>If you were using a modded skin for the MediaBrowser addon, make sure to set it in "normal Kodi mode" or just install the unmodded version of the skin.</li><li>Install the <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9984-kodi-beta-repo/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">MediaBrowser/Emby BETA repository for Kodi</a>, from the repo install the Emby addon.</li><li>Within a few seconds you should be prompted for your server-details (or auto discovered). If not, try to restart Kodi</li><li>Once you're successfully authenticated to your Emby server, the initial sync will start.</li><li>The first sync of the Emby server to local Kodi database may take some time. On a powerful machine and fast network, expect around 15-45 minutes. On a slow machine (such as a Raspberry Pi) the first sync may take up to two hours.</li><li>Once the full sync is done, you can browse your media in Kodi, syncs will be automatically done in the background.</li></ul><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><strong class="bbc">Known Issues:</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Windows users: Kodi Helix 14.2 RC1 required - other versions will result in errors with recently added items etc.</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Important note about MySQL database in kodi</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">The addon is not currently compatible with the MySQL database replacement in Kodi. Of course you can still use MySQL for your music while music is not supported by the addon currently.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><strong class="bbc">Important note about user collections/nodes</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Emby has the ability to create custom nodes/folders for your Media, such as having a separate folder for your "Kids Movies" etc. In Kodi this isn't supported, you just have "movies" or "tvshows". But... Kodi let's you create your own playlists and tags to get this same experience. During the sync the foldernode from the Emby server is added to the movies that are imported. In Kodi you can browse to Movie library --&gt; tags and you will have a filtered result that points at your custom node. If you have a skin that let's you create any kind of shortcut on the homescreen you can simply create a shortcut to that tag. Another possibility is to create a "smart playlist" with Kodi and set it to show the content of a certain tag.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">At this point, please hold on to your feature requests and report bugs only.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Report bugs or any usefull feedback on the forums</span></span></div>]]></description>

All of the following enhancements will be available in both the Google and Amazon (Fire TV) based apps.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong class="bbc">Improved Playback Interface</strong></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/5546494931a5c_newplayeratv.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The OSD when playing back items has been completely re-designed to be sleeker and provide much better information and capabilities. <span style="color: rgb(40,40,40)"><span style="font-family: Romboto">You have access to audio track and subtitle track selection as well as chapter access and direct chapter jumping like before but in a nicer display. Seeking response has also been improved when jumping ahead or back multiple times quickly (like pressing jump ahead four times in a row to go 2 minutes).</span></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong class="bbc">Netflix-style "Up Next" feature </strong></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/5546428f107f7_fireupnext.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br>Many of you have probably used the Netflix app on one of these devices and noticed the feature where it tells you what is coming up next near the end of a TV episode. The Emby Android TV (and Fire TV) app now has this same type of feature. Near the end of an item, when there is another item in the queue, you will get a display of what is coming up with the ability to start it right then or cancel playback altogether. You can also dismiss this screen by simply hitting the 'back' button on your remote in case it comes up a bit too early.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 18px"><strong class="bbc">Enhanced Live TV Playback Display</strong></span><br><br><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/554642f1221a8_livetvoverlay.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Now, when playing live TV channels, the progress display will indicate the proper program that is playing as well as the channel it is on and the progress bar will be correct in the context of the actual program.<br><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">New Unwatched Row in Movie and Series View</span></strong><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px"><span rel="lightbox"><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/553fa8f779635_unwatched.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></strong><br><br>The "Latest" row that is already there will show you your latest content that hasn't been watched in a reverse-date order but sometimes you just want to see all the items in your collection that you haven't seen.<br><br>Now the Movie and TV views include a row containing only unwatched items sorted by name so you can more easily browse to find something you haven't seen but that maybe hasn't been added to your collection recently.<br><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">More Hard-button Support</span></strong><br><br>The app now supports more direct control from your remote.<ul class="bbc"><li>Pressing the remote's "Play/Pause" button when hovered on an item in one of the list views will now directly start playing that item - bypassing the detail screen. On items like Series or Seasons, you will get a menu allowing you to Play All, Shuffle or Play the first unwatched item.</li><li>The FF and Rew buttons on the remote will now activate the jump ahead and skip back actions during playback.</li><li>If you have a custom remote (menu button) or game controller ('Y' button), you can now bring up a context menu on items within those lists that will allow you to do things like mark watched/unwatched, add to favorites or like/dislike them. On the Fire TV, the Menu button will produce this menu.</li></ul><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Trial message Error Fixed</span></strong><br><br>The incorrect message that your trial is still on-going after unlocking the app has been fixed.<br><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Supports Your Cloud Sync'ed Media</span></strong><br><br>To learn more about Cloud Sync, check out the recent server release <a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-188-emby-server-305572-released/" class="bbc_url" title="">here</a>.<br><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Installation</span></strong><br><br>This new version should automatically update on your device within the next few days or, if you want to install it on a newly supported device simply visit the Play Store on that device or access it directly <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.emby.embyatv" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">here</a>.

In unfiltered mode, you get all your channels in 50 channel pages and content for the next 12 hours.  When filtered, however, you get <em class="bbc">all</em> channels that have programs that match the filter but only for the next 3 hours.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>This is necessary to make the guide perform but it also is logical as you are most likely looking for something to watch right now or very soon.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>Filters are persistent - meaning the next time you come back to the guide, the same filters will still be applied.  You can easily clear them with the dialog "Clear All" button.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>The guide also remembers the last channel you watched and will return there upon entry.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">New Enhanced Browsing and Details screens</span></strong></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>The standard category-based grid rows are great for quick entry to likely desired content and the home screen will continue to use this interface.  When browsing into your library structure, however, this presentation doesn't provide you with as much information as it could with the available screen real estate.  So, we have re-designed the library browsing screens to still provide the category-based rows browsing but also include much more detailed information on the selected item as you are browsing around. </span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/555b418cda8ce_enhancedbrowsemovie.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>You still get the same number of posters shown at once and access to the different category rows, but we've utilized the other screen real estate to provide you useful information on the current item so you don't have to enter the details screen to see it.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>And, speaking of the details screen, we've now combined what were two levels of details into one, providing you full details about the item and all related information in just one click.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/555f977ac1fe7_newdetails.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>And you now have that details screen not just for movies and single episodes, but also for TV Series and People too.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55660e861ab16_ftvnewdetailsseries.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/555f98e98f058_newdetailsperson.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>We hope you enjoy these latest enhancements to these apps.

         <description><![CDATA[<div><span><span style="font-family: Romboto">Thanks to hamstercat, A OneDrive cloud sync plugin is now available in the plugin catalog! Please try it out and give us some feedback.</span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto">More info:</span></span><br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/21715-dropbox-cloud-sync-beta/" class="bbc_url" title="">https://emby.media/co...loud-sync-beta/</a><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">About Cloud Sync &amp; Folder Sync</span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">We worked really hard on sync during this release cycle to bring you new features that you'll find useful. Cloud &amp; Folder Sync allow you to sync media to external locations, whether it be for backup purposes or to archive content in multiple resolutions. Apps can then stream the content from the cloud instead of your server, thereby sparing your upload bandwidth.</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Let's say for example you have an original copy of a movie at 40Mbps. It looks fantastic but will require transcoding anytime you'd like to stream to Roku. Now you can sync that movie to the cloud and choose a profile that will allow Roku to direct stream:</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bcf378aa2_Untitled776.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">When your users stream the content, they'll direct stream from google drive rather than rely on your server for transcoding.</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">To setup Cloud Sync or Folder Sync, see the Services tab of the Sync control panel. Look for separate blog posts on these soon with detailed walk-throughs.</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/550b00818ca6a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></span><br><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Cloud &amp; Folder Sync are your General Purpose Conversion Tools</span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">As you sync content you're free to choose the conversion profile that will determine the output format. In future releases we intend to allow you to modify these profiles directly and even create your own.</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5505bd0ac7bd2_Untitled778.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Learn More</span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto">More information about sync is available in our wiki:</span></span><br><br><a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Sync" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/M.../Wiki/wiki/Sync</a><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"> </span></span></div>]]></description>

         <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2015 19:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>Now rolling out to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mb.android" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">Google Play Store</a>. Amazon soon to follow.<br><br>Android has been a little quiet lately and this is because well, we've been busy rewriting the app. Today, we are happy to unveil the result. It's prettier, faster, leaner, and draws inspiration heavily from the mobile web client. Let's go over the highlights of what this new version brings.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Mobile Sync is Here!</span><br><br>Mobile sync finally comes to Android. Sync everything from home videos to music, live tv recordings, movies, and more. Offline Sign In is still to come in an upcoming release. In the meantime, the app will automatically play your local content when it's available.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720df560317_sync.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Live TV Guide</span><br><br>A full guide experience finally comes to Emby for Android, making it very easy to plan out your watching or recording schedule.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720a4e17fcd_guide.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Manage Your DVR</span><br><br>Easily plan, schedule, and cancel recordings as you need to.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720a9074fc9_recordings.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">An Easy Startup Wizard</span><br><br>This has been one of the pain points of the previous version, and we're happy to say you should have no more trouble setting the app.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720aa826f1c_wizard.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720ab4a8ce4_wizard2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports Your Cloud Synced Content</span><br><br>The app works seamlessly with your cloud synced content. Check out our wiki for more information on Cloud Sync:<br><br><a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Sync" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Sync</a><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Network Switching</span><br><br>That's right! As you leave your home and return, the app will automatically switch from LAN to WAN and vice versa. No need to add your same server multiple times for home and away usage.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Full Remote Control Support</span><br><br>The app supports the full gamut of Emby remote controls, including media control, directional keys, message sending, and more.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5572121391dbc_controls.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports Chromecast</span><br><br>Just like before, easily cast audio, video and photos to Chromecast.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">A Simple and Easy Video Player</span><br><br>The new video player has everything you need, and nothing you don't in a very easy to use package.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/557212c6050e7_video.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Improved Subtitle Support</span><br><br>Subtitle selection is easier and more reliable than ever before.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/557212ea07c01_subtitles.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Easily Jump Between Scenes</span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5572131897818_scenes.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Movie Extras</span><br><br>If you have movie extras they are now finally fully supported in Emby for Android.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">In-App User Preferences</span><br><br>Now you configure your language and other preferences directly within the app. No more running to the server to set these up prior to use.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720dbf33493_profile.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Full Screen Immersive Mode</span><br><br>This is a feature with fun factor. Enable fullscreen mode under user preferences, and the app will take over the entire screen of your device. (Requires android 4.4+). It has never looked more impressive as it will in immersive mode!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720f4e7afd7_full.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports Voice Input</span><br><br>This is really a new thing and is going to take time to mature, but it has such a high fun factor that we decided to give you a taste of it. If voice control is something that interests you, then make sure to join the community and tell us what commands you'd like to see added.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720dafb4160_voice.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Easily Create Playlists</span><br><br>Playlists can now be created inside the app just by tapping your fingers! Start a playlist from a song, album, genre or artist.<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720d433558b_playlist.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Simple Search</span><br><br>Searching on Android is easier than ever before now and only takes a few taps of the finger.<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55720e8914787_search.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Discover Content With Personalized Recommendations</span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55721368f2b5b_suggestions.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Camera Upload</span><br><br>The previous version also had this but we feel it's worth mentioning. If enabled in the server, the app will automatically upload camera photos to a folder of your choice. It's perfect after a day out with the kids to come home and relive it through your photo collection.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Stable and Dependable</span><br><br>We mean this when we say it. This app will not let you down. We understand this was a problem with the previous version, and we're happy to say we've solved it once and for all.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">What to Expect</span><br><br>What you can expect with this app going forward is rapid development. We now have it in a place we're comfortable with that will allow us to easily pump out features and updates. So get involved and tell us what you would like to see!</div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new server beta is available, and it's primarily a maintenance release due to our focus on new app development.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Social Media Sharing</span><br>Before we begin: <strong class="bbc">this feature does not share any media files, only web pages containing media information.</strong><br><br>Share your content over Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and more!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a93e56accd_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>When you share, a temporary, public url will be created on your server that will display static information about your media. Here is an example:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a944a26ff7_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>As you can see, it looks like just the regular detail screen except that nothing is clickable, or even playable. It is simply an information page. It's a great way to share info about media you enjoy, while promoting Emby at the same time!<br><br>The url's that are generated are time-limited and will expire after 30 days. In a future release we may allow you to customize this. Please note, only the content you share is available through these links, and not the entire library.<br><br>As always, we understand that not everyone will want this, so it can be disabled per user as desired.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a94b3442f0_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Now Playing Design</span><br><br>The now playing bar has been redesigned to remove clutter and make the most important functions more accessible.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a92d7b21d9_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>In addition, all sliders throughout the interface have been replaced with newer, sleeker versions that provide previews of where you're seeking to.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a9315bcfec_Untitled1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Finally, the now playing screen has also been revamped into something you'll be much more likely to want to pull up on a big screen.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/559a933a7d3ce_Untitled2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Other Issues Resolved</span><br><ul class="bbc"><li>Movie titles reverting to English</li><li>Video player time position not being displayed</li><li>Folder sync file transfers moving slowly</li></ul></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>We are pleased to announce that the Windows Phone app has received a nice little update which contains a few new features and fixes. So what's new?<br><br><strong class="bbc">Emby Branding</strong><br><br>We know, took us long enough, right?! Everything in the app has been renamed, rebranded, relogo'd to use our new name and new logo. If you spot anything we missed, well, I just don't like you (but let us know and we'll get it fixed).<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/4/55a2a45e083af_Branding.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">It's Free (sort of)</strong><br><br>Previously, the app had to be purchased, but it did come with a trial mode. We felt that even though it had a trial mode, the fact the app shows as having a cost may have been putting off some users. So what this update brings is a removal of the cost for the app, whilst offering an In App Purchase in order to unlock all the features. Essentially, the app is staying the same in terms of functionality and what you are paying for, but we're [hopefully] removing the barrier for entry for new users.<br><br>I hear your next question regarding this: what if you already paid for the app? Well, there are two different In App Purchases you can make, one costs the same as the old app, the other is free. If you had already paid for the app, when you update, you will be offered the free version of the purchase, if you hadn't, you will be offered the normal priced purchase.<br><br>Funnily enough, I know your next question: What about when you reinstall the app after making an in app purchase? The app checks both the free and the normal priced license, if either of those has been purchased, you're all set.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Native Sign Up</strong><br><br>This is more for new users who wanted to create an Emby Connect account, you can do so within the app now, no more pushing you out to a web page to do it.<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/4/55a2a3b143132_SignUp.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Resuming/Playing On</strong><br><br>Previously, resuming or playing on another device could only be triggered from an episode or a movie.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Team,<br><br>The latest server release features new and improved video streaming in the <strong class="bbc">desktop </strong>editions of <strong class="bbc">Google Chrome</strong>, <strong class="bbc">Internet Explorer 11</strong>, and <strong class="bbc">Opera</strong>. Thanks to our integration with Viblast Player, we now have the ability to utilize Emby Server's HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming, which up until now has been limited to the mobile browsers and standalone apps.<br><br>This a big win for us and it brings a number of new benefits. If you're a Google Chrome user, we're finally able to eliminate the Webm streaming we had been relying on before, which has limited performance due to it's single-threaded encoding. With HLS and MPEG-DASH we're able to take advantage of multi-threaded H264 encoding, and by utilizing H264, we're sometimes able to avoid video encoding when it's possible to do so. If you're an Internet Explorer user, you'll find that video streaming is more reliable than ever as we're finally able to move away from the fragmented mp4 we had been using before. If you're a firefox user, video streaming will remain unchanged and you'll receive these benefits as soon as the browser supports the Media Source API.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">How it Works</span><br><br>Emby Server has long had support for HLS and MPEG-DASH, and you've already been enjoying it from devices such as Android, iOS, Windows 8.1, Chromecast, Roku, and others. But up until now we've been unable to utilize them in desktop browsers due to their lack of native support for these formats. Times are changing though, and thanks to growing browser support for the Media Source API, we're finally able to take advantage of these more efficient streaming formats.<br><br>Viblast Player made this very easy to integrate by allowing us to continue using the same HTML5 video player we've been using, along with the same presentation that you've come to know and love. All it took was a few lines of code to hook Viblast Player into the native video element, and off we went.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55a95f2a65055_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">What about Mobile Browsers, Safari, and Microsoft Edge?</span><br><br>These browsers already have native HLS support, and when available we will always rely on the native implementation.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">About Viblast</span><br><br>Viblast is an innovator operating in the online video industry. Its flagship product Viblast PDN optimizes video delivery to large numbers of simultaneous viewers through patent-pending peer-assisted technology. Viblast Player is one of very few available technologies for HLS and MPEG-DASH playback in HTML5 without Flash (or any plugin).<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="http://viblast.com/static/viblast_player/images/favicon.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><br><br><a href="http://viblast.com/player/" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">http://viblast.com/player/</a></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>Available in both the Google and Amazon stores very soon, Emby for Android TV and Emby for Fire TV will have a new, re-vamped player based on VLC and several interface improvements.<br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Less transcoding, better audio and easy sub switching</span></strong><br><br>The integration of VLC for playback means less transcoding, Dolby Digital audio bitstreaming (Android TV only) and fast, seamless internal audio and subtitle track switching for much of your content. Right now, VLC and direct stream playback is limited to 720p and below content by default but there are options to enable it for all or limit to SD if you encounter stuttering. Be sure to investigate the new playback options in the settings to find the combination that works best for your environment.<br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Home screen improvements</span></strong><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55c6414eebae5_newhome.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The home screen gets a couple of important improvements.<ul class="bbc"><li><strong class="bbc">Clock display</strong> - The home screen now has a clock on it that will show the current time in your local format. This clock is now consistent through all Emby ATV screens</li><li><strong class="bbc">Current user display</strong> - Additionally, each screen now shows the currently logged-in user right under the clock.</li><li><strong class="bbc">Current item detail panel</strong> - As you navigate around the home screen (and any other screen with the same layout such as by genre or performer) you will now get a pop-up information panel with details on the currently selected item. So you can now see a quick summary and time information on an item without having to drill down into the actual detail screen - making it easier to play things out of the Next Up or Recent lists.</li></ul><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55c642c087968_infopanel.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Color your world</span></strong><br><br>You can also now choose from one of several Material Design colors for the sideline category list on the home screen and other screens that have this area. No longer are you locked into Emby green or Fire TV grey.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55c643edcd9ca_homered.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55c643f8ca212_homecyan.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Other improvements</span></strong><br><br>Also included are many other improvements in display and functionality as well as bug fixes. Some of the other improvements include:<ul class="bbc"><li>Improved single episode display - The detail page for a single TV episode will now also show you the next several episodes in that season for quick access</li><li>Access the series from episode detail - Useful when you enter an episode from "Next Up" on the home screen.</li><li>Proper handling of missing episodes during multi-episode playback. If the next episode in line is missing from your library, the app will now prompt you to confirm that you want to continue playback instead of just skipping over it.</li><li>Studio logos in both details and playback OSD</li><li>Search response improvements</li></ul><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">More to come</span></strong><br><br>Look for this new version on your device or in the stores soon and know that we're working on many more improvements to come.

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new beta server is currently going out and now includes <strong class="bbc">built-in</strong> Live TV support, improved performance, and many other enhancements.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Now Supporting your HD Homerun Tuner, No External Software Needed</span><br><br>As you know we really enjoy Live TV here at Emby, but with our support previously dependent on external software, we know that it hasn't always been easy to get up and running. Today, we're pleased to bring you built-in Live TV support that does not require any additional software. Let's go over how it works.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Discovery of your HD Homerun Tuner on Your Network</span><br><br>The startup wizard makes this very simple for you. In most cases, we'll be able to discover your tuner devices. If not, then you can easily enter the IP Address of the device.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e10887351_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>M3U playlists are also supported as a tuner source.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Easy Guide Data</span><br><br>Currently we have one source, and that is Schedules Direct, but we plan to add more sources for additional countries in the future. We'd also like to support Xml TV data. Setup is very easy. Just enter your info and you're good to go.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e18eb7d16_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Your DVR Has Never Been Easier, Never Looked Better</span><br><br>We think this screen speaks for itself. Rich metadata displays make it very easy to find something you'd like to watch, or record.<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e68ef3bb3_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Enjoy Live TV on Multiple Devices</span><br><br>Whether it's Android for smart phones, tablets, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Windows Tablets, Windows Phone, Roku or a web browser, Emby has you covered.

Emby will automatically group them into one virtual channel grid, and will appropriately delegate streaming in order to prevent conflicts from multiple clients.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports HD Homerun Transcoding</span><br><br>If you have an HD Homerun that supports H264 transcoding, Emby will take advantage of it whenever possible in order to offload transcoding and preserve resources on your server machine.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Unrivaled Parental Controls</span><br><br>Would you like to limit the programs and channels your children can access? It's easy, and it's nearly automatic. When you set a max parental rating for your users, they will not even be able to see restricted programs in their TV Guide.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e59d9babc_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>To block entire channels, you can set your own parental ratings for certain channels, or you can use the block by tags feature.<br><br>To learn more about Emby parental controls, visit <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Parental%20controls" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Parental%20controls</a><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Stay Informed with Suggestions</span><br><br>Whether you like movies, sports, or just want to find something for your kids, Emby can help you find what you're looking for:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e301bee95_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Seamless Integration with other Emby Features</span><br><br>This is the fun part you'll enjoy most. Other Emby features that are designed for your media library are also accessible from Live TV. Just to name a few:<br><br><strong class="bbc">Mobile Sync and Cloud Sync</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e2a4384ba_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Suggestions</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e27e8d5bb_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><strong class="bbc">Auto-Organize</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e24e8c991_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">User Data Cross-Over </span><br><br>Your likes and watch states are now transferable from Live TV movies to movies in your media library. We plan to soon bring the same features to TV series, allowing you to blend data from every possible source into one seamless experience. Only on Emby.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">More Live TV to Come</span><br><br>We wanted to get a beta out to let you all start playing with it, but there are plenty of enhancements already in our minds, such as:<ul class="bbc"><li>Manual conflict management (currently Emby will try to automatically resolve recording conflicts)</li><li>On the fly conversion of recordings into streaming-friendly formats</li><li>More in-video features to quickly change channels</li></ul><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New and Improved Search </span><br><br>Live TV and internet channel content are now searchable!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d8c244cbe_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d8d633149_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Repeat Mode </span><br><br>Now you can toggle repeat mode using the now playing bar. It allows you to quickly change between Repeat None, Repeat All, and Repeat One. Not only is this supported by the local player, but also when remote controlling other players that have added support for it.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d7e47f29a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Play a Slide Show while you listen</span><br>The next time you play a song, head over to the now playing screen. There's a new button that will allow you to launch a photo or movie backdrop slideshow that will play and transition between images while your media is playing in the background. It's a perfect time to put family photos up on the screen with your favorite songs playing in the background.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d623a4408_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Much Cleaner Detail Screens</span><br><br>We think you'll agree.

Also, this doesn't affect xml reading, as we want the core server to be able read as many formats as possible to make it easy for new users to get up and running.</li></ul></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new beta server is currently going out and now includes <strong class="bbc">built-in</strong> Live TV support, improved performance, and many other enhancements.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Now Supporting your HD Homerun Tuner, No External Software Needed</span><br><br>As you know we really enjoy Live TV here at Emby, but with our support previously dependent on external software, we know that it hasn't always been easy to get up and running. Today, we're pleased to bring you built-in Live TV support that does not require any additional software. Let's go over how it works.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Note</strong>: The EmbyTV plugin is now obsolete and has been removed from our plugin listings. Users with EmbyTV installed should uninstall it and switch to the built-in version.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Discovery of your HD Homerun Tuner on Your Network</span><br><br>The startup wizard makes this very simple for you. In most cases, we'll be able to discover your tuner devices. If not, then you can easily enter the IP Address of the device.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8edbc5f359_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>M3U playlists are also supported as a tuner source.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Easy Guide Data</span><br><br>Currently we have one source, and that is Schedules Direct, but we plan to add more sources for additional countries in the future. We'd also like to support Xml TV data. Setup is very easy. Just enter your info and you're good to go.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e18eb7d16_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Your DVR Has Never Been Easier, Never Looked Better</span><br><br>We think this screen speaks for itself. Rich metadata displays make it very easy to find something you'd like to watch, or record.<br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e68ef3bb3_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Enjoy Live TV on Any Device</span><br><br>Whether it's Android for smart phones, tablets, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Windows Tablets, Windows Phone, Roku or a web browser, Emby has you covered. Stay tuned for iOS support as well as the new Emby Theater!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e4267baa8_5554d3ad255d9_guidefinal1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e42eeaff5_559828cb002fe_guide.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Our complete list of apps is available at:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/download/" class="bbc_url" title="">https://emby.media/download/</a><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Tuner Pooling</span><br><br>If you have multiple tuner devices, great! Emby will automatically group them into one virtual channel grid, and will appropriately delegate streaming in order to prevent conflicts from multiple clients.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Supports HD Homerun Transcoding</span><br><br>If you have an HD Homerun that supports H264 transcoding, Emby will take advantage of it whenever possible in order to offload transcoding and preserve resources on your server machine.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Unrivaled Parental Controls</span><br><br>Would you like to limit the programs and channels your children can access? It's easy, and it's nearly automatic. When you set a max parental rating for your users, they will not even be able to see restricted programs in their TV Guide.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e59d9babc_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>To block entire channels, you can set your own parental ratings for certain channels, or you can use the block by tags feature.<br><br>To learn more about Emby parental controls, visit <a href="https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Parental%20controls" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Parental%20controls</a><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Stay Informed with Suggestions</span><br><br>Whether you like movies, sports, or just want to find something for your kids, Emby can help you find what you're looking for:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e301bee95_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Seamless Integration with other Emby Features</span><br><br>This is the fun part you'll enjoy most. Other Emby features that are designed for your media library are also accessible from Live TV. Just to name a few:<br><br><strong class="bbc">Mobile Sync and Cloud Sync</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e2a4384ba_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc">Suggestions</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e27e8d5bb_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><strong class="bbc">Auto-Organize</strong>:<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8e24e8c991_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">User Data Cross-Over </span><br><br>Your likes and watch states are now transferable from Live TV movies to movies in your media library. We plan to soon bring the same features to TV series, allowing you to blend data from every possible source into one seamless experience. Only on Emby.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">More Live TV to Come</span><br><br>We wanted to get a beta out to let you all start playing with it, but there are plenty of enhancements already in our minds, such as:<ul class="bbc"><li>Manual conflict management (currently Emby will try to automatically resolve recording conflicts)</li><li>On the fly conversion of recordings into streaming-friendly formats</li><li>More in-video features to quickly change channels</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">New and Improved Search </span><br><br>Live TV and internet channel content are now searchable!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d8c244cbe_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d8d633149_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Repeat Mode </span><br><br>Now you can toggle repeat mode using the now playing bar. It allows you to quickly change between Repeat None, Repeat All, and Repeat One. Not only is this supported by the local player, but also when remote controlling other players that have added support for it.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d7e47f29a_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Play a Slide Show while you listen</span><br>The next time you play a song, head over to the now playing screen. There's a new button that will allow you to launch a photo or movie backdrop slideshow that will play and transition between images while your media is playing in the background. It's a perfect time to put family photos up on the screen with your favorite songs playing in the background.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d623a4408_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Much Cleaner Detail Screens</span><br><br>We think you'll agree. Detail screens are easier to read and focus on the things you love most.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d53f876cc_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d5530dd36_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Taglines are Back in Style</span><br><br>We really haven't used them in a while due to the number of metadata features we have. But they add a nice touch to your movie screens, we just felt we had to bring them back.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/55d8d71805bac_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Voice Commands Added</span><br><br>You can now switch devices as well as toggle display mirroring. Just speak the following out loud:<ul class="bbc"><li>Control [device name]</li><li>Enable/Disable/Toggle display mirror</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Other Changes and Fixes</span><ul class="bbc"><li>Fixed people getting lost when local metadata saving is not enabled</li><li>Sym links not working on certain Linux distros</li><li>Music artist screens now display similar Artists</li><li>Fix live tv stream closing on Roku</li><li>Fix Portugese with open subtitles</li><li>Dlna special views use series images for better episode identification</li><li>Fixed Chromecast Live TV playback</li><li>Movie ratings not respecting language settings</li><li>Single quotes in subtitle file names causing transcoding failures</li><li>Mobile sync for apps will now prevent duplicate synced items</li><li>Fixed roboto font url</li><li>Updated to ffmpeg 2.7</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Existing Feature Changes</span><br><br>As we add new features, we constantly have to re-evaluate and look for ways to ensure the system continues to perform well and is easy to use. So to that end, here are a few changes that we've made:<br><ul class="bbc"><li>Support for MB2-style shortcuts has been deprecated in order to improve performance. They are still supported for boxsets, but if you need them elsewhere you will have to set a hidden config setting, EnableWindowsShortcuts.</li></ul><ul class="bbc"><li>The internet channel content downloading feature has been moved to a plugin. All features are still available, it's just in a plugin now.</li></ul><ul class="bbc"><li>For fresh new installs of the server, there will only be one supported metadata saving format per content type. If you need xml saving it is being moved to a plugin. Please note - the feature remains in the core server code for existing server installations. That means your existing install won't be disrupted at all. But the next time you install from scratch, you'll need the plugin if you want the alternative formats. Also, this doesn't affect xml reading, as we want the core server to be able read as many formats as possible to make it easy for new users to get up and running.</li></ul></div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new release of the Android TV and Fire TV app will soon available in the Google and Amazon stores with another round of improvements to both playback and the interface - especially for Live TV users.<br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Live TV - better than ever</span></strong><br><br>The Android TV and Fire TV app already had a great Live TV interface with a full grid-based guide and now it is even better with that same guide available <em class="bbc">during</em> Live TV playback.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f33718e187f_liveoverlayguide1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Also, accessing and managing your recorded TV and schedules has never been easier.  Together with the new Emby TV implementation in the server, Emby is becoming your complete Live TV and DVR solution (for non-protected content).<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f33878b54ea_newrecordedtv.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">Improved Playback - Even less transcoding and auto bitrate detection</span></strong><br><br>With an upgrade to the custom VLC player, and the implementation of ExoPlayer, we now have even more reliable playback and many formats will direct stream without the need for transcoding.<br><br>This version of the app is also smarter when it comes to determining what can be played without transcoding. With a new "Auto" bitrate setting (which will be enabled by default on update) the app will test your network speed and adjust its playback requests to the server to fit within the available bandwidth. You should no longer need to fiddle with the max bitrate setting to get perfect playback no matter what the network situation.<br><br>This new version also improves support for all subtitle formats.<br><br><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size: 18px">New Grid View</span></strong><br><br>Continuing the trend of improving the overall interface and making it much easier to browse large libraries of content, the app now includes a new Grid View to put more items on the screen at once when browsing at the library level.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f339535bc34_newgrid2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>The new grid allows quick sorting and filtering options that are saved per user and per library and are persistent across app sessions. When sorted alphabetically, it also provides a quick jump-list by letters.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f339a34b5ff_jumplist.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br>A choice of image types is also available.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f339fbc6403_gridbanner.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>This new view makes traversing large libraries much easier and really shines when it comes to things like Photos (more photo handling improvements will be coming in a future version as well).<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/3/55f33a3058699_photogrid.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>Look for the new version soon on your Android TV or Fire device and thank you for supporting Emby!</div>]]></description>

         <pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 15:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>This is a small bug-fix update to the previous release to help tide you over while we work hard on the next major release. The following issues have been resolved:<br><ul class="bbc"><li>Fix external subtitles sometimes requiring burn-in via transcoding.</li><li>Fix error on forgot password screen</li><li>Fix frame by frame analysis for linux</li><li>Frame by frame analysis setting now off by default for all users due to longer library scans. Users will need to re-enable this feature.</li><li>Fix server-side stream copy decision making</li><li>Fix live tv series recordings not creating new recordings after initial run</li><li>Content with unidentified parental ratings are now considered unrated instead of always being allowed. This way, if you enable block unrated content, you will not have to worry about accidentally exposing your child to adult content just because the server couldn't understand the rating.</li></ul></div>]]></description>

         <title>Coming soon: The new Emby Theater</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/coming-soon-the-new-emby-theater.html</link>
         <pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>The new Emby Theater is getting closer to launch, so we thought why not give you a little teaser to wet your appetite.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Same Great Video Player, Brand New App</span><br><br>The app retains the same great Direct Show audio and video player that you're accustomed to, including all of it's bells and whistles with Madvr and other perks. But make no mistake, this is a brand new app and has been truly a massive team effort.<br><br>So what's different about this new app? Read on!<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc276520b9_1.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Sharper and Crisper Than Ever Before</span><br><br>The first thing you'll notice when playing with the new app is just how much crisper it is. How has this been achieved? Unlike the previous version of the app (and Emby for WMC), the new Emby Theater renders at resolution without any form of UI scaling. This will create more work for the theme developer to design for different resolutions (720p, 1080p, 4k, etc), but the results are worth it.<br><br>We love the current Emby Theater, but this is going to make it look like an old tube TV.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc399d86b6_2.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Silky Smooth Animation</span><br><br>The next thing you'll notice is just how fluidly the interface navigates. Dramatic performance improvements have been made over the previous app. Almost everything on-screen is animated and it really helps make the app more pleasant to use.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc455555ea_3.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Emby Theater Going Multi-Platform</span><br><br>While Windows is the focus right now, the app has been built in a very ambitious way to allow for release on a wide range of different platforms. We will probably have to rely on community help for some platforms, but the possibilities are there.<br><br><strong class="bbc">Note</strong>: Please contact us if you have interest in maintaining a build for a specific OS. Responsibilities will include initial packaging for that OS, regular release updates, and answering user questions specific to the OS.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">6-Button Control</span><br><br>There will be no more fumbling around trying to figure out what button does what. The new app will be easy for anyone to pick up and use without any learning curve. All functions are being designed around 6 buttons - up, down, left, right, ok, and back. Your family members and guests will have no trouble controlling the new Emby Theater.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Simple Theming</span><br><br>This app has the potential to change the game of new theme development. When all is said and done it will be easier to build themes for this than any other app in it's class.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Free of Clutter</span><br><br>Enjoy your artwork thanks to the clean design and clutter-free header bars.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Rediscover your Content with Recommendations</span><br><br>A popular feature from other Emby apps is finally making it's way to Emby Theater.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc4cbd936c_4.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Music Interface</span><br><br>The app finally has a design that makes sense for music.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc545a351b_5.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc54f225c6_6.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Live TV</span><br><br>Watch Live TV, browse the guide, and manage your recordings.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc57e1fec4_7.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Details Gone Vertical</span><br><br>A common complaint over the detail screen of the current Emby Theater is that it's pretty but slow to navigate. We went back to the drawing board and decided to take a little inspiration from Android TV. It is now much, much faster to browse through detail screens.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc89cf3d3c_8.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc98a1d3b0_9.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Stay Tuned for a Beta</span><br><br>Keep your eyes on the blog for a downloadable beta, coming soon.<br><br>Also the app will soon be open source. We appreciate your patience this. We have kept the source code closed in order to allow us to control the timing of announcements, but it will be fully open source just like all of our other apps.</div>]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<div>A new beta is currently rolling out to the website for download. This time around, there are only a few new features.

Remember to first configure your Open Subtitles account in the server dashboard.<br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5621647b34288_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Add to Collection from Any Screen</span><br><br>Collection management has been moved out of the metadata manager and is now available on nearly every screen, allowing you to add content to collections from wherever you are, including search. To remove items, visit the detail screen for the collection.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">New Multi-Selection</span><br><br>Performing bulk operations is now a snap with the new multi-select feature. To activate, simply click and hold on just about any poster on any screen. <br><br><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/562165efd2e26_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span><br><br>This even works when you're mobile. Just tap and hold.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Drag and Drop Playlist Items</span><br><br>The title says it all.

The web interface is now more responsive to server changes when browsing with Firefox.</li><li>Fix people not downloading images</li><li>Fix deleted content showing in search</li><li>Fix offline content detection</li><li>Fix folder sync resyncing content repeatedly under certain conditions</li><li>Reworked internal providers to improve Anime plugin (thanks Aphid).</li><li>Fix identify movie search results limited to one title</li><li>Fix marking seasons watched not working for episodes directly in a series folder</li></ul><span style="font-size: 24px">Important Note about this Release</span><br><br>This release introduces some database changes.

         <title>Emby Server Beta 3.0.5781.6 Released</title>
         <link>https://emby.media/emby-server-beta-3-0-5781-6-released.html</link>
         <pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 21:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
         <description><![CDATA[<div>Team,<br>We've released another patch release. This one will start as a beta and hopefully move along to stable by the end of the week. There is one important fix and a few new improvements.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Fixed: Roku crash when playing content with a runtime longer than 2 hours</span><br><br>Thanks to the community members who helped track this one down. You can read more about this issue here:<br><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/27511-roku-reboots-when-starting-playback/" class="bbc_url" title="">https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/27511-roku-reboots-when-starting-playback/</a><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Improved Chrome Transcoding</span><br><br>This is a very exciting improvement that dramatically reduces cpu utilization when transcoding with Chrome. If your source content is h264, and certain conditions are met, you'll now enjoy the original video stream as-is, without any conversion except for the audio track.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Internal Web Client Improvements</span><br><br>This is the main reason we're starting this release as a beta. Although you won't notice very many visual changes, the web client has been getting revamped under the covers and you'll notice faster browsing performance all throughout. Please report any issues you come across and we'll resolve them as quickly as we can.<br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Linux Package Improvements</span><br><br>We'll have a separate post about this, but our linux packages are seeing a lot of improvements as well. Notably:<br><ul class="bbc"><li>Added support for openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap</li><li>Beta and Dev releases are now using the package embymagick for ImageMagick libraries. embymagick does not get installed as a system library, so there should no longer be conflicts with distribution releases of ImageMagick.</li><li>New restart wrapper script, in order to alleviate some of the issues posted by users.</li><li>Sudoers file has been updated, restart permission have been moved to the group emby rather than the user emby.</li><li>Emby-Server start wrapper script ensures user running emby-server is part of emby group, and thus are granted restart permission.</li><li>Support RPI 1 thanks to openSUSE ARM factory. Please see the following: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM%C2%A0" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://en.opensuse....org/Portal:ARM</a></li><li>AARCH64 will be supported as soon as there is a release from the mono team.</li><li>Used mono aot (ahead of time compiler) to hopefully increase performance.</li><li>Debian maintainer  post install script are set to ignore home of user emby, use default configuration file and etc conf file rather than /etc/passwd to determine were user settings should be kept.</li></ul><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>Special thanks goes to fc7, hurricanehrndz and all their awesome work and to any and all users who have taken the time to report issues and have had the patience to work with us as we get them addressed. </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br>Docker users please stay tuned for a major update that is under works. There will also be more clear documentation for installing on the RPI and other arm devices. In terms of ARM support, on Debian distro we only support armv7l and those binaries can be found in our xUbuntu_14.04 repo.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Are You Strong with HTML, JavaScript and NodeJS?</span><br><br>I am looking for someone on the advanced side who can work with me directly on new Emby projects. Please contact me if you're interested in contributing.</div>]]></description>

Once this goes stable we'll have separate stable packages.<br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-size: 24px">Other Linux Package Improvements</span></span></span><br><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto">We'll have a separate post about this, but our linux packages are seeing a lot of improvements as well. Notably:</span></span><ul class="bbc"><li>Added support for openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap</li><li>Beta and Dev releases are now using the package embymagick for ImageMagick libraries. embymagick does not get installed as a system library, so there should no longer be conflicts with distribution releases of ImageMagick.</li><li>New restart wrapper script, in order to alleviate some of the issues posted by users.</li><li>Sudoers file has been updated, restart permission have been moved to the group emby rather than the user emby.</li><li>Emby-Server start wrapper script ensures user running emby-server is part of emby group, and thus are granted restart permission.</li><li>Support RPI 1 thanks to openSUSE ARM factory. Please see the following: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM%C2%A0" class="bbc_url" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">https://en.opensuse....org/Portal:ARM</a></li><li>AARCH64 will be supported as soon as there is a release from the mono team.</li><li>Used mono aot (ahead of time compiler) to hopefully increase performance.</li><li>Debian maintainer post install script are set to ignore home of user emby, use default configuration file and etc conf file rather than /etc/passwd to determine were user settings should be kept.</li></ul><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Special thanks goes to fc7, hurricanehrndz and all their awesome work and to any and all users who have taken the time to report issues and have had the patience to work with us as we get them addressed. </span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span style="font-family: Romboto">Docker users please stay tuned for a major update that is under works. There will also be more clear documentation for installing on the RPI and other arm devices. In terms of ARM support, on Debian distro we only support armv7l and those binaries can be found in our xUbuntu_14.04 repo.</span></span></span></div>]]></description>

We are discussing the possibility of an Emby client for Samsung Tizen TVs and will keep you posted on that.</span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><span style="font-size: 24px">Installation</span></span></span><br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9869-samsung-smart-tv-app-install-instructions/?p=277344" class="bbc_url" title=""><span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue">2014 H-Series Install</span></span></a></span></span><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9869-samsung-smart-tv-app-install-instructions/?p=277345" class="bbc_url" title="">2013 F-Series Install</a><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9869-samsung-smart-tv-app-install-instructions/?p=277346" class="bbc_url" title="">2012 E-Series Install</a><br><a href="https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/9869-samsung-smart-tv-app-install-instructions/?p=277348" class="bbc_url" title="">2011 D-Series Install</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/61171/566bf043ec9ff_4Movies.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/61171/566bf04d2a378_5Trailer.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/61171/566bf031a6540_1Home.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></p></div>]]></description>

         <title>Emby for Chromecast Gets Major Update</title>

         <description><![CDATA[<div><p>We've updated our Chromecast app with a major overhaul. Here's what's new:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px">All New Video Transcoding</span><br>The receiver now enjoys the same transcoding used by the Chrome browser. Not only will you see <strong class="bbc">faster video start times</strong>, but also <strong class="bbc">faster seeking</strong>, and <strong class="bbc">reduced cpu utilization</strong> on your server. In many cases now we'll just stream copy the original video while only transcodng the audio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While we could go on and on about the benefits, we think the words of a fellow community member sum it up best:<br></p><blockquote class="ipsBlockquote"><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Technically the new implementation is hot stuff imo, well done!!<br>- shorty1483</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px">New Opus Audio Transcoding</span><br>Music transcoding now uses Opus, which has superior quality to both aac and mp3. Audiophiles will agree, the results very pleasant. Direct stream of FLAC is still supported on Chromecast devices that support FLAC, but if not, then OPUS is not the transcoding format.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px">Full Support for Changing Audio and Subtitle Tracks</span><br>Up until now this has only been partially supported and we apologize for the wait in completing this feature. Now you can change both audio and subtitles on the fly using the casting app.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px">Automatic Bitrate Detection</span><br>Our Chromecast receiver will now perform bandwidth tests with your Emby Server to determine the ideal bitrate. For the majority of users this is the recommended approach. To activate or change this, configure it in the casting app's settings:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/568e876199760_Untitled.png" alt="Posted Image"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please note - Android and iOS do not have this setting yet, but we'll get updates out to support it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px">How to Get The Update</span><br>To receive the update, simply power cycle your Chromecast device and reconnect from the casting app.<br><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"><span><img class="bbc_img" src="https://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/5416200a4bb67_53f77010a8549_MirrorDetail.jpg" alt="Posted Image"></span></span></span><span><span style="font-family: Romboto"> </span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span style="font-family: Romboto">Enjoy, and let us know what you think P)</span></span></p></div>]]></description>

<![CDATA[
a</a> and <a href='https://tv.emby.media' class='bbc_url' title=''>https://tv.emby.media</a> (supports the latest versions of Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This app has been a long journey and we're finally pleased to announce availability for Emby Premiere subscribers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size: 24px'>Same Great Video Player, Brand New App</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The app retains the same great Direct Show audio and video player that you're accustomed to, including all of it's bells and whistles with Madvr and other perks. Andrew Van Til from <a href='http://www.missingremote.com/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Missing Remote</a> has been helping us and we can't think him enough. This app has been truly a massive team effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what's different about this new app? Read on!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size: 24px'>A Modern App for Modern Times</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The interface for this app has been built with HTML, but this is nothing like the web apps you're accustomed to. This has been built purely with modern features that bring a level of performance that wasn't even possible a year ago at this time. For the nerds out there, that means <a href='https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>WebAnimations</a>, <a href='http://webcomponents.org/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>WebComponents</a>, Service Workers, <a href='https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Polymer</a>, and on and on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To run this app on Windows, we've utilized <a href='https://www.chromium.org/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Chromium</a>, <a href='http://electron.atom.io/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Electron</a>, and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>NodeJS</a>. Then we replaced the web audio and video player with a player built specifically for Windows, which you can read about below. With HTML and JavaScript as the basis, the possibilities are going to be endless.<br /><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc276520b9_1.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Sharper and Crisper Than Ever Before</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The first thing you'll notice when playing with the new app is just how much crisper it is. How has this been achieved? Unlike the previous version of the app (and Emby for WMC), the new Emby Theater renders at resolution without any form of UI scaling. This will create more work for the theme developer to design for different resolutions (720p, 1080p, 4k, etc), but the results are worth it.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>We love the old Emby Theater, but this is going to make it look like an old tube TV.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc399d86b6_2.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Silky Smooth Animation</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The next thing you'll notice is just how fluidly the interface navigates. Dramatic performance improvements have been made over the previous app. Almost everything on-screen is animated and it really helps make the app more pleasant to use.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc455555ea_3.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Emby Theater Going Multi-Platform</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We want to bring this app to as many platforms as we can, including Smart TV's, Android, and others. With HTML as the basis we have a foundation that will allow this app to run on just about anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>6-Button Control</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>There will be no more fumbling around trying to figure out what button does what. The new app will be easy for anyone to pick up and use without any learning curve. All functions are being designed around 6 buttons - up, down, left, right, ok, and back. Your family members and guests will have no trouble controlling the new Emby Theater.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>If You Can Do HTML and CSS, You can Build Themes for Emby Theater</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of you have probably worked with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Building themes and plugins is as simple as forking existing samples on Github and creating your own versions. We're excited to see what you come up with. We'll have more info on this coming soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Rediscover your Content with Recommendations</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>A popular feature from other Emby apps is finally making it's way to Emby Theater.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc4cbd936c_4.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>New Music Interface</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The app finally has a design that makes sense for music.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e1f53aa9_10.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e137cf1f_11.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Live TV</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>Watch Live TV, browse the guide, and manage your recordings.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc57e1fec4_7.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e33030aa_Untitled.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Details Gone Vertical</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>A common complaint over the detail screen of the current Emby Theater is that it's pretty but slow to navigate. We went back to the drawing board and decided to take a little inspiration from Android TV. It is now much, much faster to browse through detail screens.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc89cf3d3c_8.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc98a1d3b0_9.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size: 24px'><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>Wait, if This is HTML...</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>Does that mean the built-in web app could be made to animate as smoothly as Emby Theater?</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>Yes! It can, and it will.

ers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size: 24px'>On Windows, the Same Great Video Player in a Brand New App</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The app retains the same great Direct Show audio and video player that you're accustomed to, including all of it's bells and whistles with Madvr and other perks. Andrew Van Til from <a href='http://www.missingremote.com/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Missing Remote</a> has been helping us and we can't thank him enough. This app has been truly a massive team effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You might be wondering <strong class='bbc'>what took you guys so long</strong>? This is essentially our third major design of the app. You're all familiar with the original. We then began an overhaul built with C# and WPF, and by overhaul, we mean a re-write from the ground up. Then in early 2015, I began scheming about the idea of a full-featured HTPC app built with HTML. It is my belief that Web API's have evolved to the point where they are now truly the best option, and that led to another fresh start building the app from the ground up. Make no mistake, this is not a Smart TV app ported to the HTPC, this is a new app designed to support all the bells and whistles you've come to expect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what's different about this new app? Read on!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='font-size: 24px'>A Modern App for Modern Times</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The interface for this app has been built with HTML, but this is nothing like the web apps you're accustomed to. This has been built purely with modern features that bring a level of performance that wasn't even possible a year ago at this time. For the nerds out there, that means <a href='https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>WebAnimations</a>, <a href='http://webcomponents.org/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>WebComponents</a>, Service Workers, <a href='https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Polymer</a>, and on and on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To run this app on Windows, we've utilized <a href='https://www.chromium.org/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Chromium</a>, <a href='http://electron.atom.io/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Electron</a>, and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>NodeJS</a>. Then we replaced the web audio and video player with a player built specifically for Windows (mentioned above). With HTML and JavaScript as the basis, the possibilities are going to be endless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To release the app on other platforms such as Linux, Mac or Android, we would follow the same process and provide you with the best audio and video players that the platforms have to offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty soon we'll have additional announcements on how you can build skins with HTML, and we can't wait to unveil that.<br /><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc276520b9_1.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Designed for 10ft, but Works Great With a Mouse and Touch Input</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We've put a lot of effort into all three input mechanisms. We want this app to work well however you'd like to use it. We think the best way is a remote, but if you'd like to scroll with the mouse or swipe with your finger, that works great too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong class='bbc'>Note</strong>: Although the app supports touch input, it does not currently have any mobile designs, therefore it is not ideal for small screens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Sharper and Crisper Than Ever Before</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The first thing you'll notice when playing with the new app is just how much crisper it is. How has this been achieved? Unlike the previous version of the app (and Emby for WMC), the new Emby Theater renders at resolution without any form of UI scaling. This will create more work for the theme developer to design for different resolutions (720p, 1080p, 4k, etc), but the results are worth it.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>We love the old Emby Theater, but this is going to make it look like an old tube TV.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc399d86b6_2.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Silky Smooth Animation</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The next thing you'll notice is just how fluidly the interface navigates. Dramatic performance improvements have been made over the previous app. Almost everything on-screen is animated and it really helps make the app more pleasant to use.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc455555ea_3.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Emby Theater Going Multi-Platform</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We want to bring this app to as many platforms as we can, including Smart TV's, Android, and others. With HTML as the basis we have a foundation that will allow this app to run on just about anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>6-Button Control</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>There will be no more fumbling around trying to figure out what button does what. The new app will be easy for anyone to pick up and use without any learning curve. All functions are being designed around 6 buttons - up, down, left, right, ok, and back. Your family members and guests will have no trouble controlling the new Emby Theater.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>If You Can Do HTML and CSS, You can Build Themes for Emby Theater</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of you have probably worked with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Building themes and plugins is as simple as forking existing samples on Github and creating your own versions. We're excited to see what you come up with. We'll have more info on this coming soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Rediscover your Content with Recommendations</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>A popular feature from other Emby apps is finally making it's way to Emby Theater.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc4cbd936c_4.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>New Music Interface</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>The app finally has a design that makes sense for music.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e1f53aa9_10.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e137cf1f_11.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Live TV</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>Watch Live TV, browse the guide, and manage your recordings.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/561bc57e1fec4_7.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span rel='lightbox'><img class='bbc_img' src='http://emby.media/community/uploads/inline/2/56d75e33030aa_Untitled.png' alt='Posted Image' /></span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'><span style='font-size: 24px'>Details Gone Vertical</span></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style='color: rgb(40,40,40)'><span style='font-family: Romboto'>A common complaint over the detail screen of the current Emby Theater is that it's pretty but slow to navigate.
